<body><br><strong>Current Language</strong><br><br>&nbsp;Welcome to Textbook Revolution!&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Purpose of the site</strong><br>Textbook Revolution is a student-run site dedicated to increasing the&nbsp; use of free educational materials by teachers and professors. We want&nbsp; to get these materials into classrooms.

Here you will find reviews and links to books and course materials released that are freely available online, many of which are published under free and open licenses.&nbsp;<br><br>Textbook Revolution is a sharing space for links to free and open educational resources. The site operates exclusively on user participation.<br><br><br>FIND Reviews Textbooks and Courses<br><br>SUBMIT new textbook reviews or courses.<br><br><br>At Textbook Revolution, you&#8217;ll find links to textbooks and select&nbsp; educational resources of all kinds. Some of the books are PDF files,&nbsp; others are viewable online as e-books.

All of the books are offered for free (as&nbsp; in beer and speech) by their respective copyright holders.
