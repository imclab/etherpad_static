<body><strong>FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY</strong><br><br><strong>Things to improve:</strong><br><br><strong>Vocabulary</strong> - what do we call it, a Challenge? a Course?<br><br><strong>Copy </strong>- need to work before a final version on the help popovers and starter text. Remove the text &quot;elevator pitch&quot;<br><br><strong>Text Area Size</strong> - Some of the text areas (task description mainly) seem too small but it should not be indicative of the final version,&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Save Progress</strong> - May not be obvious where to find saved stuff. When we confirm save, may want to tell the user where to find saved work later<br><br><strong>Next Button</strong> - Should save draft after each page automatically. (this is intended but not explicitly stated)<br><br><strong>Task Limit</strong> - The form supports unlimited tasks, we may want to put an artificial limit in (maybe 15?) because lots of tasks may break other pages and may be better off split into two challenges. For sure we don&#x27;t want challenges with 500 tasks.<br><br><strong>Task Editing</strong>: using one of the new live-preview editors that are out there, to see how each task looks in real time. Define how the accordion for the tasks works.will i.e. 1 always go into focus after clicking edit? say I have 14 tasks and I want to edit task number 8... any chance I can say somehow that the task to be edited is #8?<br><br><strong>Inconsistent editing</strong> - On the review page the top part seems to send the user to a different page to edit, while the bottom allows inline editing. I think both of those should be consistent (inline or on another page) but not mixed.<br><br><strong>Delete</strong> - I&#x27;d say that we shouldn&#x27;t put this button right next to save (accidental click and we don&#x27;t want them to give up). Maybe not show it at all on the wizard. Instead the delete button could be shown in the profile next to the challenge (with a confirmation against accidental clicks).<br><br><strong>Examples</strong> -&nbsp; Would love to see examples of good content&nbsp; as part of the creation process<br><br><strong>Number of hours it might take to complete a challenge</strong>:Asking for the number of hours to completion when you haven&#x27;t had a chance to create any tasks yet should only be indicative. Once you start the challenge you should be able to track how long users take to complete it and display an &quot;average time to complete.&quot; (we track that metric already btw) Others also suggested that How many hours should come at the end of the task design process.<br><br><strong>Skills</strong>: It would also be nice to add a &#x27;helper&#x27; box&#x2F;cloud from where usual skills (tags) can be chosen from.<br><br><strong>Other commen</strong>ts:<br>Help: Keep a &#x27;Help&#x27; section consistently in the same position throughout the 3 pages in the form of tips. {?} buttons - we can pull articles from the knowledge base (help.p2pu.org) or manually write them<br><br>Concerns about making the &#x27;not sure where to start&#x27; section a different colour being enough. I am of the opinion that you should be sure (to a certain extent) of what you are doing before going into the process of creating a challenge. This does not mean that any help sections are not needed during the process, but I would place this section more prominently and add a smaller &#x27;tips&#x27; section to all three pages, with those tips targeted to each of the page.<br><br>Define how community review works.<br><br>Define page that comes before this &gt; i.e. community asked&gt; is this the SECOND part of the creation process? The first form a creator should be taken to should be about their intentions i.e. synchronous discussion group or project based challenge, etc.<br><br><br></body>
