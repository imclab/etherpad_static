There are manuals in&nbsp; many languages on great desktop and android applications. The thing that&nbsp; binds it all together is that these are resources written under a free&nbsp; licence about applications also written under a Free Software licence.&nbsp;<br><br>The&nbsp; vast majority of all manuals on FM have been created and maintained by&nbsp; people putting in voluntary contributions of their time. This creates a&nbsp; very stable community and home for the manuals and allows us to do a lot&nbsp; with a little.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We are always looking for people who love writing about Free&nbsp; Software. We maintain a database of writers, translators, facilitators&nbsp; and workshop leaders. Please get in touch if you have work that needs&nbsp; doing or if you are available for work. You can also do a lot of other&nbsp; things to help: PR, write code, reach out to other projects, start a new&nbsp; language community, raise money etc.<br>If you are interested in volunteering or want to find out more, the best thing is to join our mailing list and ask how you can get involved.<br>Writing, Editing and Fact Checking Manuals<br>Anybody&nbsp; can contribute to a manual. To get access to the &quot;write&quot; area of the&nbsp; site, all you need to do is to create a login ID on booki.flossmanuals.net.&nbsp; By creating a login ID, you agree to release what you create here under&nbsp; the GNU General Public License.

Here are some of the activities&nbsp; you get involved with:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>writing new manuals</li><li>updating or improving existing manuals</li><li>proofreading manuals as they are being written</li><li>reviewing and fact checking.</li></ul>Networking &amp; Fundraising<br>There&nbsp; are so many great manuals and resources as part of the FLOSS Manuals&nbsp; network, in so many different languages. Sometimes it seems like we are&nbsp; so busy writing them that we don&#8217;t have enough time to promote our&nbsp; manuals as much as needed.We would really appreciate help spreading the&nbsp; word.<br><br>Promotion can be a challenge for volunteer-based&nbsp; communities. However our large user base works well to help us promote&nbsp; the FLOSS Manuals. Here are some of the ways you can help:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>write a blog post about FLOSS Manuals and our recent activites (see our news page)</li><li>embed our bookstore widget in your website</li><li>write a review of one of our manuals.</li></ul>You&nbsp; can help out by keeping us in the loop about projects and partners that&nbsp; may be good for us to make contact with. If you see a funding&nbsp; opportunities that could support our work, do let us know.<br>Helping with the Tech Infrastructure<br>Volunteering&nbsp; for FM as a tech could be a great way to help many Free Software&nbsp; communities in one go. It is also a great way to learn about innovative&nbsp; publishing formats for online publishing, and online collaborative&nbsp; software that can output to many different formats.<br><br>We are&nbsp; looking for people with a good working knowledge of Python, Django, php&nbsp; or css theming. FLOSS Manuals is build around the Booktype software. At the moment we have a few projects that we really need help with:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>installing the latest version of Booktype and migrating our current content there.</li><li>working to set up a new Booktype install (and front page in php) for a new FLOSS Manuals in Spanish</li><li>theming existing sites with php and css.</li></ul>Using FLOSS Manuals for Teaching<br>The&nbsp; best road-testing of our documentation is when it is used in real-life&nbsp; workshops. Please try out some of our manuals for teaching or as open&nbsp; educational resources for online learning.<br>If you are looking to&nbsp; prepare a workshop using Free Software, we would be delighted to work&nbsp; with you to help you acheive this. We may be able to point you in the&nbsp; direction of existing resources that fill your need. We may be able to&nbsp; share techniques to help you overcome any barriers to teaching this&nbsp; material.<br>Most of all we would welcome your feedback on using the&nbsp; manuals, workbooks and courses at FLOSS Manuals so that together we can&nbsp; keep them up-to-date and make them even better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></body>
