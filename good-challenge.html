<body><br>Chloe Notes on What makes a good Challenge 08&#x2F;29&#x2F;2011<br><br><strong><u>What makes a good challenge?</u></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Simple setup, complex problem</strong>: The challenge uses a simple setup that requires learners to find the solution to a complex problem.<em>For example, in the &quot;Bring it all together&quot;&nbsp; challenge learners have to create a portfolio site (simple setup) but the problem they have to solve has many layers (complex) ; they have to sketch,&nbsp; design and develop wireframes to build their portfolio site.</em></li><li><strong>Taking on a role:</strong> learners take on an identity or a multiple set of identities such as&nbsp; programmer, collaborator, activist, ice cream lover. In so doing they become committed to the space and the community in which the&nbsp; complex learning challenge is situated.?</li><li><strong>Having a &quot;need to know&quot;: </strong>The challenge is meaningful for the learner audience. There is a need for them to master the skills required to complete the challenge. <em>For example there is a personal motivation for the learners, such as creating your own portfolio site, or a community related one, such as leveling up and becoming a Guru&#x2F;Mentor or winning a competition among the community, and even a fun factor such as a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge.</em>&nbsp; A need to know could be designed as a combination of some&#x2F;all of the above. In doing so the learners find the challenge meanigful and personally fulfilling.</li><li><strong>Belonging to a larger context </strong>: challenges level up and are grouped together in what could be called a Quest&#x2F;Mission&#x2F;etc. The architecture of the Quest&#x2F;Mission allows for one to take linear or non-linear learning paths. <em>For example in the Webmaking101 -let&#x27;s name it- Quest, a user can take some challenges through a linear path (as they appear, first, second,third etc) and other challenges through non-linear paths (like a choose your own adventure)</em></li><li><strong>Clear goals:&nbsp;</strong> the challenge&#x2F;or group of challenges has a clear overall goal, such as building a portfolio. A challenge goal can consist of smaller goals or combinations, such as building a portfolio site, winning badges,&nbsp; getting community credit etc</li><li><strong>Receiving feedback along the way:</strong> Learners receive feedback on their actions as they progress through the challenge or a group of challenges. (this could be were badges,points, progress map etc come in)? <em>For example,(from the top of my head) in the Better,Faster,Stronger&nbsp; challenge, the learner get&#x27;s feedback on the time taken for his&#x2F;her&nbsp; portfolio content to load.</em> A key idea here is that of a <strong><em>feedback loop</em></strong>; that allows usesr based on the challenge assessment to redo their previous action or take a new action based on the assessment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Smartools:</strong> Moving through levels of the challenge unlocks smartools.&nbsp; A smartool is something a learner can use again and again in other challenges. <em>For example, Firebug (if Firebug was to be unlocked as a tool after completing challenge x) is a type of smartool.</em></li><li><strong>There is risk-taking and exploration</strong>: Learners are encouraged to take risks, explore, and try new things (trial and error). <em>For example, in the MishMash challenge you have to?create grids to lay out your work and there might be several sizes of grids that you can create, so during the process you might tinker with many grid sizes (trial), make a couple of ugly layouts(error) untill you find the one that works best.</em> *Note:something to think about is how we create a SAFE space for trial and error to happen and even been celebrated.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>&#x27;Flow&#x27;:</strong> Learners feel that there is flow in the experience, meaning that the challenge tasks are &#8221;doable,&#8221; but increasingly challenging. ?{chart here <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;bit&#x2e;ly&#x2F;qXjL7X">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;qXjL7X</a>}</li><li><strong>Balanced scaffolding</strong><em>(related to flow):</em> scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a challenge that, if too difficult, could prevent them from moving forward.&nbsp; However, it&#x27;s important not to build in so much scaffolding that users can get through the challenge without actually&nbsp; learning anything {ref. Hussain,Taib}</li><li><strong>A sense of agency:</strong> Learners feel a real sense of agency and control over what they are learning and doing in the challenge.?For example, there could be an ability to edit some challenges and remix them or a requirement to create your own challenge after completing this first course&#x2F;quest&#x2F;mission.</li><li><strong>There are many solutions to the same problem:</strong>&nbsp; different users can solve the same problem in different ways.? Being&nbsp; able to compare the different solutions is equally important. (this&nbsp; concept ties to &quot;Replayability&quot;, see below)</li><li><strong>Fun &amp; Replayability:</strong> the challenges are *so* enjoyable that users will &quot;re-play&quot; certain ones that lead to different outcomes or allow them to pledge higher expertise (maybe a guru version of a badge). Adding a layer of<em> community competition</em> to this fact, such as a &#x27;code-off&#x27; in the <em>I&lt;3 command line</em> challenge for example, increases the replayability of the challenge.
