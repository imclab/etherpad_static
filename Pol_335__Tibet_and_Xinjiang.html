Why are Tibet and Xinjiang strategically important to China today? Ilyas Kayran<br><br><br><br><br><br>2.a) How would you characterize the pre-1911 relationship between China and Tibet?

Davis outlines in his paper &#8220;Tibet and China&#x27;s &#x27;National Minority&#x27; Policies.&#8221;<br><br>During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a loose imperial association existed between the two countries. (Davis 436)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>At the time of the Yuan Dynasty (1270-1368),&nbsp; when the Mongol Empire controlled the countries, it administered Tibet and China separately. (Davis 437)<br><br>In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), a diplomatic relationship existed between China and Tibet with the latter acting as intermediaries between the Chinese Ming court and the Mongol emperors. (Davis 437)<br><br>During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), China invaded and occupied Tibet but the latter was treated as a vassal state and indirectly ruled as part of China&#x27;s external empire. (Davis 436-7) There was no serious incorporation of Tibet and it remained separate from China. (Davis 437)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>2. b) How would you characterize the pre-1911 relationship between China and Xinjiang? Kerry Hall<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Central Eurasian Studies professor Gardner Bovingdon examines the historical relationship of Xinjiang and China in his book chapter on Xinjiang. He concludes Xinjiang became a province of China after the latter forcibly colonized it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), the Chinese Emperor Qianlong conquered Xinjiang in 1759 and ruled the area as a colony with military garrisons. (Bovingdon 338)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the late 1700s, the Chinese promoted immigration to the region such that, by the early 1800s, the half-million population was made up of about 165,000 Hans and 300,000 Turkis (Uyghurs). (Bovingdon 338)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; In 1864, a warlord from Kokand (Uzbekistan) led an uprising with the Turkis (Uyghurs) and gained control over almost all of the area. (Bovingdon 338)&nbsp; However, in the mid-1870s, the Chinese reclaimed most of the territory following a military campaign. (Bovingdon 338)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; In 1884, the colony was designated a formal province named Xinjiang (New Frontier), although Han immigration decreased following the transformation.
