<body><strong><u># Embed Badges to your Challenge&nbsp;</u></strong><br><br><strong>Description:</strong> First of all, <strong>WHAT&#8217;S WITH THE BADGES? </strong>There&#8217;s something new happening here at P2PU. Mozilla, makers of Firefox, has developed an Open Badges framework, a way to record, track, and display your skills and knowledge across the web. By creating a challenge you can connect specific tasks to a set of badges that highlight your learners technical and community skills to your friends, colleagues and potential employers. In this challenge, we will learn how to embed badges in your challenge.<br><br>Gear: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;</a>,&nbsp; post-its and markers.<br><br>Time: 2 hours<br><br>Photo: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;flickr&#x2e;com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;mozillaeu&#x2F;6318647136&#x2F;in&#x2F;gallery&#x2d;mozilladrumbeat&#x2d;72157627965849097&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;mozillaeu&#x2F;6318647136&#x2F;in&#x2F;gallery-mozilladrumbeat-72157627965849097&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong><u>## Task 1 - Start with the skills</u></strong><br><em>Connect skills to one or more tasks inside your challenge</em><br><br>Before you get started on creating your first set of badges, <s>bring in front of you</s> have the post-it notes outlining the skills you want to teach from challenge 1 [link] in front of you. If you need to add extra skills or take away those that <s>you don&#x27;t think</s> no longer apply to your challenge<s> anymore</s>.&nbsp;<br>To complete this task try to directly connect these skills to one or more tasks inside your challenge. Think of who your audience is and what is meaningful to them; for example will they want to show off the badge you are giving them on their personal portfolio site? Now, try to translate these skills into roles. What will you be asking them to do during the task? that can provide the basis for your badge title. For example, if you are asking your peers to master the art of baking in one of your tasks then &quot;Master Baker&quot; is an awesome badge title.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u>## Task 2 -&nbsp; Link to evidence&nbsp;</u></strong><br><em>Think of concrete ways to assess peer work</em><br>&#x2F;&#x2F;working on this ...<br><br>It is time to ask yourself; what are your peers making that proves that they have mastered the skills you want to teach them? Whatever that is; a video tutorial, a theatrical play or a street game you should consider it part of the evidence that qualifies someone to apply for a badge. Try to be very specific in what you require your peers to submit as part of the badge application. Remember, peers other than you will have to evaluate whether this person deserves a badge so the more clues you give them, the better.<br><br>You can see here how we linked a badge to what the peers were making in the &#8220;HTML is all around you&#8221; challenge. [link]&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Tip # 1</strong>: If you are finding yourself stuck, look around you for inspiration. The point here is that you do not have to reinvent the wheel; research other courses, websites, games or activities that support similar learning goals. Don&#8217;t be literal in your research, sometimes things that are not obvious precedents can be very inspiring. For example, you could get inspired by Ze Frank&#8217;s sandwich project to scout a piece of HTML code like &lt;div&gt; around your neighborhood like we did to create the &#8220;HTML is all around you&#8221; challenge.<br>(will add to this tip, doesnt make sense as it stands)<br><br><strong><u>## Task 3 -Find your badge-type&nbsp;</u></strong><br><em>Identify what categories do your badges fall into</em><br><br>In this task you will match the badges that you have created to one out of the four types of badges we use here in p2pu.org.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Skill badges;</strong> badges awarded from challenge creators, mentors and peers.<br>These badges are meant to recognize technical skills and should be linked to the deliverables of a task. These badges are awarded by mentors and peers&nbsp; based on a rubric evaluation of a 1-4 scale as well as an endorsement. In order to receive this type of badge one would need 3 peers or 1 mentor to give an evaluation of higher than 3 in the rubric.<br><br>Here is an example of a skill badge : <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;html&#x2d;basic&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;html-basic&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong>Peer badges;</strong> badges awarded from peer to peer<br>These badges are meant to help build the community and recognize 21st century skills. Below are some initial badges that we have identified based on work with LinkedIn recommendations, as well as discussions with the Webcraft community. [link to all existing peer badges]. These badges are available for peers to award to other peers, along with an endorsement. If multiple peers award one with the same badge then it accumulates (so a Team Player badge may have a score or indication that I received it 3x).<br><br>Here is an example of a peer badge : <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;helpful&#x2d;feedback&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;helpful-feedback&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong>Mentor badges; </strong>badges awarded from challenge creators. These badges are meant to recognize individuals who have offered to mentor others in the challenge. These badges are awarded directly by challenge creators.<br><br>Here is an example of a mentor badge : <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;mentor&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;mentor&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong>Completion badges; </strong>badges awarded automatically by completing all tasks in a challenge.<br>Here is an example of a completion badge :<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;writing&#x2d;html&#x2d;by&#x2d;hand&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;writing-html-by-hand&#x2F;</a><br><br>Once you have identified what categories your badges fall in to you can move to the next task.<br><br><strong><u>## Task 4 - Add description &amp; rubrics (better title TBD)</u></strong><br><br>In this task you will write a description for each of your badges and share your work with the community using <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;</a>, or another free collaborative text editor tool of your choice. The purpose of the description is for your learners to understand why it is important to <s>own</s> (perhaps &quot;earn&quot;?) this badge and what they should do to get it.&nbsp;<br><br>Here is an example to guide you through this process:<br><br><em>Badge Category: Peer</em><br><br><em>Badge Description: The Super Blogger Badge recognizes the ability to consistently write informative, engaging and well presented blog posts while explain clearly and concisely concepts to various audiences.</em><br><br><em>Badge Rubric (for Skill badges only)</em><strong>:</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Writes engaging blog posts</li><li>Writes clearly and concisely</li><li>Includes thoughtful and creative presentation of materials</li><li>Accurately communicates concepts and information to various audiences, including nontechnical people</li><li>Spends extra time writing supportive blog posts outside the Webmaking 101 task</li></ul><br>You can also check the review process for a skill badge here : <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;dns&#x2d;basic&#x2F;submissions&#x2F;13&#x2F;assess&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;dns-basic&#x2F;submissions&#x2F;13&#x2F;assess&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong><u>## Task 5- Give feedback to your peers</u></strong><br><em>Check out your peers posts and give them suggestions</em><br><br>You can&#x27;t consider this challenge finished until you have left comments on some of your peers pads or posts. Here are some questions to guide your feedback; Are the badges they are suggesting representative of their audience? Are they meaningful? Is the evidence requested adequate? Are there any other badges you would like to suggest to your peers?&nbsp;<br><br>================<br>Community Feedback<br>================<br>Note #1 In the close future when we will know EXACTLY what the technical process for creating badges will be, we will include a more detailed task # 6 that explains that.<br>Note #2 We are still working the badges categories, and by no means are these &quot;perfect&quot; so in your comments please feel free to make suggestions or give feedback on that.<br><br>Task 2 Tip one: Link to the Ze Frank example and tell this story a bit more (ie &quot;When we were creating the HTML is all around you challenge, we stumbled upon this [link}. We thought the Blah was really interesting....&quot;). How did you get from the Earth Sandwich to HTML is all around you? What was the thought path? If you can tell this story in a sentence or two, keep the example, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to someone who wasn&#x27;t involved in the process. And going to the Earth Sandwich site doesn&#x27;t reveal your thought pattern<br><br></body>
