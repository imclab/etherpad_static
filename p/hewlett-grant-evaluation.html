<body><br>E) Outcomes<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Ultimate outcome 1: </em><strong>P2PU and other social learning projects are better able to track and demonstrate the quality of their courses, and the achievements of their learners, and to use these data to improve the learning experience and achievements, over time in a measurable way. </strong>Intermediate outcomes and outputs in support of ultimate outcome 1:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>A conceptual framework for analysis and validation of deeper social learning in open education communities like P2PU. This framework will highlight how social learning in open communities like P2PU can be evaluated, and how deeper learning in these settings can be observed, studied, and demonstrated.&nbsp;</li><li>Software for assessment and tracking of learning achievements at P2PU that is shared under an open source software license.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Ultimate outcome 2: </em><strong>Participants in social learning projects such as P2PU have improved access to reputable, appropriate, and affordable certification options.</strong> They are able to demonstrate their skills to third parties (including to employers to get jobs). Intermediate outcomes and outputs in support of ultimate outcome 2:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>P2PU provides increasingly efficient and relevant pathways to accreditation based on outcomes data that leads to ongoing refinements of the courses, curricula, assessments, etc.&nbsp; CPE credits from UCI are awarded to peer learners in P2PU courses. We better understand what aspects of deeper learning increase learners&#x27; ability to obtain traditional certification.&nbsp;</li><li>Mozilla badges for web developers are awarded to peer learners in P2PU courses. We better understand how new types of certification might be appropriate to represent deeper learning outcomes.</li></ul></li></ul><br>F) Evaluation&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Evaluation is an integral part of the overall project management and not a separate activity. Also see indicators listed in the programme chart.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Learners: </em>Learning objectives as defined by respective learning communities, including metrics covering content knowledge, cognitive strategies and learning behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><em>Courses: </em>Metrics for evaluation include: number of courses, number of participants enrolling for courses, number of participants completing courses.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Certificates &#x2F; Badges</em>: Number of assessments sought out and badges earned to reflect the learning that is occurring, as well as the validity of and interest in the badge system. Also, number of participants awarded CPE credits through UC Irvine.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Graduates: </em>For those who completed courses and attained certification: employment and other opportunities gained through completing P2PU courses. In the time-frame of the project, we can&nbsp; realistically only gather anecdotal evidence, but we will put in place the necessary monitoring processes to be able to track long-term results.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Community: </em>Size of the P2PU community, number and quality of new partnerships especially leading to additional certification pathways, frequency and venue where P2PU is mentioned.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>G) Logic Model<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;cl&#x2e;ly&#x2F;image&#x2F;081W2t2j1b1n">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cl.ly&#x2F;image&#x2F;081W2t2j1b1n</a></li></ul><br><br></body>
