<body>This is a joint proposal for School of Open and School of Data to run a hackathon&#x2F;workshop for &quot;open&quot; challenges at the OKFestival, the theme for which is &quot;Open Knowledge in Action&quot;.<br><em>17-22 September 2012 in Helsinki, Finland</em><br><br>Session will run 19 September, Wed from 2:00pm-5:30pm<br><br><strong>Priority Deadline: Fri, April 20, 2012</strong><br><br>&quot;focus on the <em>value</em> that can be generated by opening up&nbsp; knowledge, the ecosystems of organisations that benefit from and&nbsp; participate in sharing, and the impact that open knowledge can have in our societies. What kinds of new professions, ideas and community initiatives can emerge within our governments, markets, networks and neighbourhoods as a result of these engagements?&quot;<br><br><br><strong>Title *Name of the project and&#x2F;or short description (for example &#x27;A workshop on participatory budgeting&#x27;)</strong><br><br>&quot;Open&quot; Challenges Workshop for School of Open &amp; School of Data<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Content *Please describe *what* you would&nbsp; like to present at OKFestival (a project &#x2F; community &#x2F; tool &#x2F; prototype &#x2F;&nbsp; research paper &#x2F; etc).&nbsp;</strong><br><br>We&#x27;ll be presenting the School of Open and the School of Data, and talking a little bit about how P2PU works as an open community of learners and educators across all domains! (data, science, education, libraries, etc.). The presentation part will take 5 minutes; the session is intended to be a workshop! We want to go through the collaborative process of designing and developing various challenges in the domains the group is interested in. Depending on interest, we&#x27;ll split up into several groups, and create challenges on how open tools, standards, and practices can be applied to virtually any task&#x2F;project&#x2F;organization. Challenges can be anything from &quot;How to create an open music video&quot; to &quot;How to get your journal to be Open Access&quot; to &quot;How to attribute CC-licensed photos&quot; to &quot;Using (open) data to prove your point&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Format Optionally, you can also&nbsp; describe *how* you would like to present it (a lecture? a workshop?&nbsp; hackathon? something else?). We would like to encourage you to consider&nbsp; using other formats than traditional lectures and panel discussions!</strong><br><br>Workshop&#x2F;Hackathon. 3 hours? w&#x2F;potential to run all day... - I think 3 hours (i.e. a morning&#x2F;afternoon sounds about right. Bill it for too long and there&#x27;s a danger people may not come :))<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Keywords *Keywords related to your proposal</strong><br><br>open education, design challenge, peer learning, open data, open licenses<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>People *Involved people and organisations (please also mention the home countries)</strong><br><br>Jane Park, School of Open (P2PU &amp; Creative Commons)&nbsp;<br>Laura Newman, School of Data (P2PU &amp; Open Knowledge Foundation)<br>Philipp Schmidt(?), P2PU<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Links Relevant websites</strong><br><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;schools&#x2F;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;schools&#x2F;school-of-open&#x2F;</a><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;11&#x2F;29&#x2F;the&#x2d;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.p2pu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;11&#x2F;29&#x2F;the-school-of-open&#x2F;</a><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;blog&#x2e;okfn&#x2e;org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;announcing&#x2d;the&#x2d;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;data&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.okfn.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;announcing-the-school-of-data&#x2F;</a><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;</a><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Additional information (PDFs, images, etc) If you want to submit additional information, please upload these online and send us the URL.</strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Contact person name *</strong><br>Jane Park<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Contact person email *</strong><br>janepark at creativecommons.org<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Contact person phone&nbsp;</strong><br>jane&#x27;s phone<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Questions for the Open Knowledge Festival organisers?&nbsp;</strong><br><br></body>
