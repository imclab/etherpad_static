<body><strong><u>Developing countries</u></strong><br>Dany and Stian<br><br>Question (Philipp): What are the concrete next steps &#x2F; tasks?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Original notes from Planning</strong><br><br><em><u>9 - Session: participation of P2PU in the educational process of emerging countries</u></em><br><em>Add your name if you want to work on this: (Dany, zuzel, Philipp, Niels)</em><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Presentation about Latin America currently,and work done so far.</em></li><li><em>Is it time to start working P2PU in Emerging Markets?</em></li><li><em>Communications and press community members?community committees?</em></li><li><em>work from universities.</em></li><li><em>is the actual p2pu model enought for this challenge?</em></li></ul><br><br><strong>Current model</strong><br><br>about 12 people in Columbia, and Spain, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Chile (1-2 in each country). Started with a course that Dany ran in P2PU, that&#x27;s where he met the other volunteers.<br><br>started out by going to universities and giving presentation, and recruiting students - focused on new entering students, a new university cycle starts every 6 months<br>courses were run with offline sessions in the university (gave free space), as well as some live online sessions (using Wiziq)<br><br>have friends and friends of friends invite them to speak in with HR departments of companies, ask if they are looking for staff, and what specific skills. They are planning to use this information to design the courses going forward.<br><br>When a student finishes a course, we search for opportunities, and send the student to apply for certain jobs.&nbsp;<br><br>new model: having the course entirely online using P2PU platforms (already being tested for one course)<br><br>Own platform: Giweb.com - so far used that to coordinate courses. Might continue to use it as a community space after courses transition to P2PU.org.<br><br>30-40 people in Columbia have gotten jobs as a direct result of P2PU HTML5, Python, php, frontend etc courses. These are part-time jobs, allowing the students to continue in their studies, and earn money to support their study fees.<br><br>In Argentina, several people have also gotten jobs through the courses.<br><br>In Colombia, currently 120 students involved from 5-6 universities all in Bogota.&nbsp;<br><br>Receive support from Mozilla community in Columbia (invite to events etc)<br><br>Next cycle of new university students in Latin America in February 2012<br><br><strong>What can P2PU do to support the Latin American effort?</strong><br><br>organization<br><ul class="bullet"><li>need to clarify the use of P2PU logo and name - can we say we are representatives of P2PU, create P2PU schwag etc (this is also relevant when contacting media)</li><li>how can we officially represent P2PU at conferences (some need proof that we represent a certain organization)</li><li>relate this to P2PU ambassadors or P2PU fellows project</li><li>currently most coordination between the representatives in Latin America is done through Skype meetings - not much written records, mailing lists etc<ul class="bullet"><li>the time and way of joining these calls should be made public</li><li>every time they should take collaborative notes in Etherpad (or other) and share on the p2pu-espanol afterwards</li><li>Rebirth of P2PU-Espanol</li></ul></li><li>who to contact about putting stuff in blog, announcement - publicizing achievements etc</li><li>future plan: maybe try to apply for some funding specific to Latin America<ul class="bullet"><li>support a Latin American P2PU meetup&#x2F;work camp</li><li>Global Day</li><li>schwag (very important)</li><li>attend more events</li></ul></li></ul><br>technology (platform)<br><ul class="bullet"><li>would be nice to have integrated voice&#x2F;video meeting capability in platform (now they use Wiziq).&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Dany</strong> to test if BBB is useful</li></ul></li><li>Better discussion capacity (more like a forum or chat room, right now the task pages are not smooth enough to conduct a lively discussion)</li><li>Poll&#x2F;quiz functionality&nbsp;</li><li>Review of the course by students when they finish it&nbsp;</li><li>Really need to move language picker to top right and make more visible - many people use software in English but speak other languages</li><li>get &quot;Get involved&quot; page translated to Spanish (check with Zuzel how to do this</li><li>add info about community mailing list, community calls etc&nbsp;</li><li>would be nice with a map to see where different users are located - also to coordinate local events, etc</li></ul><br></body>
