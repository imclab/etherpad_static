Want to make learning peer-based, engaging, hands-on. Developed a challenge model and platform to support it.

Picked a content area that was amenable to learning innovation (no entrenched competition, users generally online and innovative, low barriers to entry for alternative certification). Experimented with process for identification of important skills. Fostered a community of users. Currently rolling out other experiments (learning challenges, badges) through SoW.
