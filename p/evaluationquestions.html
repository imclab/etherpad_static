<body><strong><u>End of Course Evaluation Questions</u></strong><br><br>A series of statements can be used and allow people to Disagree strongly -&gt; Strongly agree. A lickert scale is easier to analyze. Then have a few selected open ended questions.&nbsp;<br><br>12 are related to course content, the amount of work, the facilitator, the engagement. 3 are about their &quot;net promoter score&quot;. There are 4 open ended questions. We can get permission to use recommendations. Finally there are the School of Webcraft specific questions, I didn&#x27;t know how you want to analyze those, so I didn&#x27;t change them.<br><br><strong>General Questions</strong><br><br>Rate these statements.&nbsp;<br>1 If you agree strongly<br>2 Agree<br>3 Neither agree nor disagree<br>4 Disagree<br>5 Disagree strongly<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>The course satisfied my own needs and expectations.</li><li>The course met the objectives as outlined.</li><li>I feel I contributed to the class discussion and progress.</li><li>The pace of the course kept me interested.</li><li>I was motivated to learn.</li><li>I feel there was a good rapport among the participants of the course.</li><li>I feel I lost a sense of engagement towards the end of the course.&nbsp;</li><li>The materials presented had practical relevance.&nbsp;</li><li>The amount of work was reasonable or adequate.</li><li>The assignments were too frequent or too numerous.&nbsp;</li><li>The content was presented in an organized and logical manner.&nbsp;</li><li>The course facilitator communicated clearly and was supportive.</li><li>I would recommend this course to someone</li><li>I would recommend participating in P2PU</li><li>I would join another P2PU course in the future</li></ul><br><strong>Open ended questions</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>What was the best aspect of your course?
