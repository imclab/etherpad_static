<body><u>Project Ideas</u><br><br>Host competitions - example: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;desire2learn&#x2e;com&#x2F;edgechallenge&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.desire2learn.com&#x2F;edgechallenge&#x2F;</a><br><br><br><u>Background</u><br><br><em>Aim of this section is to set the stage for the strategy discussion. Tried to pull together early discussions and articulate in a way that broadly resonates.</em><br><br>Problem we are solving<br><ul class="bullet"><li>The problem -&gt; not enough minds are set on fire</li><li>Its cause -&gt; the university has lost its way. instead of creating a global culture of learning it has commoditized learning and knowledge.</li></ul><br>(Problem we are NOT solving)<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Not enough people can get &quot;degrees&quot;</li></ul><br>What could we be great at (what evidence can we collect?)<br><ul class="bullet"><li>(a) Offer learning opportunities that help people succeed in their lives, or ..</li><li>(b) Build a community of people who are like us and experiment &#x2F; promote &#x2F; build new ways of learning?</li><li>Combine research, practice, ....</li><li>Finding the right people and drawing them in</li><li>Offering alternative learning opportunities outside of institutional walls</li><li>Inspiring a global community&nbsp;</li><li>Offering education that is not provided by the mainstream system (long-tail, alternative models)</li><li>Modeling what learning online can look like (are we really?)</li></ul><br>What do we stand for?<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Not just imagining what is possible, but building it</li><li>Learning by doing and iterating</li><li>Community</li><li>Open as a mechanism for participation</li><li>Peer learning</li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Questions</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>How do we think of impact?<ul class="bullet"><li>Direct -&gt; millions learn and teach on our learning platform</li><li>Indirect -&gt; our work inspires others, together we create a culture of learning that reaches millions</li></ul></li><li>Who is the customer?<ul class="bullet"><li>End-user who needs education or education innovators who reach the end-users?</li><li>Discussion in Berlin: P2PU is all about &quot;community&quot; and about giving anyone the opportunity to find their passion and pursue it. Can we be the lab that moves the system in this direction, but we won&#x27;t reach everyone ourselves? Does that feel right?</li><li>How about: &quot;anyone who wants to create new models, tools, or prototypes which don&#x27;t yet have a home in institutions or p2pu.org&quot;?&nbsp; For those who are<ul class="bullet"><li>Creating new courses that don&#x27;t &quot;fit&quot; in the p2pu.org platform</li><li>Creating courses using other tools (e.g. a MOOC run on wordpress)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>P2PU as a lab is a series of experiments, with or without partners</li><li>The community participates in applied research</li><li>Experimentation is the engine of innovation<ul class="bullet"><li>Increases our understanding of how to improve social learning online</li><li>Drives development of the platform</li><li>Drives development of other tools</li></ul></li><li>Success of P2PU is not 100% tied to product (Lernanta)<ul class="bullet"><li>Harder to measure impact, e.g. what&#x27;s our impact on badges?</li></ul></li><li>Lab framing feels like a natural fit for existing P2PU identity &#x2F; community<ul class="bullet"><li>Alignment around values and a desire to innovate education, not around the use of a particular platform</li></ul></li><li>Some experimentation takes place outside of p2pu.org - how do we feel about that?&nbsp;</li></ul><br><br><strong>What we need to fix in order to change higher education (Lab focus areas)</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Re-imagine online learning &#x2F; How do courses work? - Moving from courses to learning challenges, mentoring</li><li>Assessments that work like the web - Badges pilot, learning challenges, badges</li><li>New credentials - Badges</li><li>Blended learning - SoSI</li><li>Break the dichotomy of teacher and learner... all need to participate in designing and running their educations</li><li>Technology and tools<ul class="bullet"><li>&quot;The Wire&quot; blog aggregator</li><li>Pilot site &#x2F; model - wiki &amp; mailing lists</li><li>Drupal based learning management system</li><li>Lernanta social learning platform</li><li>Django OBI integration</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><strong>How would this impact the role of our platform (Lernanta)?</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Starting point:<ul class="bullet"><li>A page to list &quot;labs projects&quot;</li><li>An option in the &quot;create a course&quot; page to just create a &quot;course&quot; which is just is a link to a course run on an external site.&nbsp; Give those course icons a special marker that shows they&#x27;re run externally.</li></ul></li><li>Allows others to extend &#x2F; expand &#x2F; experiment</li><li>Accomodates different approaches, models</li><li>P2PU needs to feel more hackable (like a wiki - allowing users to make their own in ways that we may not have imagined)</li><li>Do we need a two platform approach (production and lab.p2pu.org) - or do we make production more experimental (unstable)<ul class="bullet"><li>Platform for experimentation</li><li>Social learning product that evolves through experimentation</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><strong>How would we move in this direction?</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Run more hackathons to experiment with new ideas<ul class="bullet"><li>Bring together developers and education folks to build prototypes</li></ul></li><li>Beef up metrics, research, data expertise<ul class="bullet"><li>Data sharing policy (and defined processes) to enable research partnerships</li></ul></li><li>Focus onboarding process on reaching innovators and bringing them into the community</li><li>Technology implications:<ul class="bullet"><li>Support experiments on other platforms&nbsp;</li><li>Make Lernanta hackable (define interfaces so Lernanta can link to other tools, offer an API, encourage and support extension of our code)</li><li>Give equal attention to a lab&#x2F;experimentation space and a production space</li><li>Support clear process that moves results from lab into production&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><strong>The Pitch</strong><br><br>&nbsp;are&#x2F;is the university built by everyone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;are&#x2F;is an open lab for social online learning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;are operated by a grassroots community of education innovators.<br>&nbsp;host hundreds of courses that are free and open.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;build on existing educational content available on the web and help people connect with each other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;organize learning outside of institutional walls.<br>&nbsp;give learners recognition for their achievements.<br>&nbsp;build tools and foster communities<br>&nbsp;foster community<br>&nbsp;prototype new models and scale ideas that work<br>&nbsp;share everything we learn with the world<br>&nbsp;invite the world to build the future of education together with us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;unlock ... the power of peer learning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;operate an online learning platform<br>&nbsp;hosts hundreds of courses with tens of thousands of users<br>&nbsp;test ideas<br>&nbsp;build prototypes<br>&nbsp;scale things that work<br>&nbsp;develop tools<br>&nbsp;ask questions<br>&nbsp;find answers<br>&nbsp;learn<br><br></body>
