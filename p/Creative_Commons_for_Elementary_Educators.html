<body><strong>What course are you interested in creating as part of the School of Open?&nbsp;</strong><br><em>When you think about creating a course, ask yourself, &quot;What do I want to help people DO?&quot;&nbsp; versus &quot;What do I think people should know or learn?&quot; For example, I&nbsp; want to help:</em><br><br>We want to help elementary (or primary) educators easily find and use free, useful resources for their classes. We also want to help them think of and incorporate activities that teach their students digital world skills -- such as finding, remixing, and sharing digital media and materials on the web.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>How can open content, tools, or processes help people do what they do better?</strong><br><em>Open practices include <strong>using</strong></em><em> the content, tools and processes shared with us, <strong>enabling</strong></em><em> others to use, share and adapt what we create, and <strong>supporting</strong></em><em>&nbsp; transparency in our content, tools and processes. If a course involves&nbsp; teaching or learning about any of these practices, either broadly or in a&nbsp; particular field, then it probably fits in the School of Open.&nbsp;</em><br><br>Elementary educators can take advantage of open educational resources, or OER, for when they need free materials to supplement lesson plans -- or even for creating new lesson plans. They can also tap into the OER network of teachers already sharing and using materials with each other. They can share their own work online, contributing to the pool of shared OER and simultaneously to the improvement of their resource by other teachers. They can lead by example, for other teachers but especially their students by finding, creating, remixing, and sharing their own work first through a collaborative online project. They can then incorporate a similar activity for their students, having them learn these web relevant skills and directly experience the benefits of engaging with open resources and the collaborative process. Teachers can share their own experiences about the course transparently, via blogs and social media.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Is there a specific aspect or mechanism that keeps people from taking advantage of open stuff?</strong><br><em>Think&nbsp; about the key obstacles that discourage someone from learning about&nbsp; openness, applying open tools, or sharing their work openly. For&nbsp; example, what&nbsp; might cast doubt into a musicians mind when it comes to using openly&nbsp; licensed material? Why might a graphics designer refrain from sharing their works openly? Are there good reasons for not going fully open or are certain misconceptions playing a role?</em><br><br>Elementary educators may be restricted by district determined curricula (lack of flexibility), restricted internet access through school systems, time, resources, training, and child privacy laws. Child privacy laws are good reasons for teachers to not share their students work, except anonymously. They might also be restrained by their district policy around who owns the content they create and&#x2F;or use.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Who are you trying to help? Think about the course from the learner&#x27;s standpoint.&nbsp;</strong><br><em>Who&nbsp; will be taking the course? What real world questions is s&#x2F;he likely to&nbsp; ask? What needs is s&#x2F;he likely to have and barriers s&#x2F;he is likely to&nbsp; run into?&nbsp;</em><br><br>Elementary&#x2F;primary educators. Open to anyone in the world, but we will be facilitating course from US pacific time zone.<br><br>Create a user scenario:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Draw the person you are trying to help.</li><li>List 3 questions (or more) that person would ask or list 3 problems s&#x2F;he needs help solving.<ul class="indent"><li>1. How do I find free stuff I can use in my courses, legally?</li><li>2. How do I know the stuff I find is free to use?</li><li>3. Why should I teach my students about finding and sharing open content?</li><li>4. How do I get my students to share online without violating their privacy? Will I be risking my job if we do collaborative projects via the Internet?</li><li>5. Who owns the resources I create? remix?&nbsp;</li><li>6. Why should I share my own resources online?</li></ul></li><li>Describe that person&#x27;s situation in a few sentences or short paragraph, either out loud or written down.<ul class="indent"><li>Jill Samberg is a 5th grade teacher. She is teaching writing composition from district determined curricula, but has some leeway in the activities and exercises she might have her students do. She finds the old composition books boring and irrelevant to the digital age, and really wants her students to incorporate digital resources, like multimedia, into their learning. She has some time, as she is willing to improve her lesson plan for personal and professional enrichment, but no extra money or other resources to put towards this effort. She would like to find examples of what other teachers have done, in addition to free resources she might adapt for her class. She also wants her students to be able to find and incorporate media - but to do so without breaking any copyright laws. Her main goal is to get her students to be excited about writing composition, while at the same time learning more relevant writing skills for the digital present and future - whatever learning forms this may take.</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>What can you reuse and build on?</strong><br>Do openly licensed resources already exist that explain&#x2F;teach any of this?&nbsp; Are people already teaching or learning about related topics elsewhere that you can tap to collectively build the course?<br><br>Yes, some - we plan to adapt and incorporate as appropriate the list of resources at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;p&#x2F;Courses&#x5f;for&#x5f;kids">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;Courses_for_kids</a>.<br><br><strong>Document your thinking behind the course and learning activities</strong><br>The learner may ask, why am I doing this?

Is there a general unit this would fit into best?

Might be simpler for them to merely&nbsp; post to the discussion? Or alternatively set up a course blog they all&nbsp; post to?</s></strong></li><li>I like the book Shared Creations: Making Use of Creative Commons and&nbsp; activities in it - nice resource<s>.<strong> Might be worth capturing from course&nbsp; participants one or more K-12 resources that stand out for them as being&nbsp; exceptional. Teachers like to hear from other teachers about great&nbsp; resources they are using that others may also find useful.</strong></s></li><li><strong><s>it may be worth delineating between openly licensed resources (eg.&nbsp; images, audio, video, &#8230;) from openly licensed K-12 curricula (eg. CK-12,&nbsp; curriki, &#8230;) Openly licensed resources are in a sense raw materials, not&nbsp; necessarily created with educational intent, that teachers can include&nbsp; in courses to supplement and enhance core curricular materials. Openly&nbsp; licensed K-12 curricula has been authored with educational intent and&nbsp; usually are intended to fulfill mandated learning outcomes. I think K-12&nbsp; educators will be interested in both but will appreciate this&nbsp; distinction as it helps them think through just what they might be&nbsp; looking for in terms of open resources.</s></strong></li><li>the more I look at the descriptions we use for our CC licenses at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;</a>&nbsp; the more I think we need to more carefully use terms like remix, tweak,&nbsp; build upon, redistribute, and download. No where do we define what we&nbsp; mean by any of these terms and I think some differentiation between them&nbsp; could be helpful. The way I see it there is a difference between an&nbsp; adaptation, a remix and a collection. All three have different&nbsp; implications when it come to licensing and attribution. <strong><s>Expect K-12&nbsp; teachers will appreciate something that helps clarify these differences.</s></strong><s>&nbsp; This could involve activities that, 1. create an adaptation, 2. create a&nbsp; remix, 3. create a collection.</s></li><li>one of the main questions I repeatedly get in K-12 is &quot;how to&nbsp; evaluate the quality of OER?&quot;. <strong>An activity that helps K-12 teachers&nbsp; understand how OER quality can be assessed may be useful - see </strong><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;achieve&#x2e;org&#x2F;oer&#x2d;rubrics"><strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.achieve.org&#x2F;oer-rubrics</strong></a><strong> for example</strong></li></ul>Feedback from Christina Hendricks<br><ul class="bullet"><li>1. In the &quot;ETMOOC&quot; course I&#x27;m a part of right now (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;etmooc&#x2e;org&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;etmooc.org)</a>&nbsp; we have similar communication tools as what you suggest (blogs,&nbsp; twitter, discussion board--though ours is through Google+), but we also&nbsp; have a social bookmarking group that we can contribute to. Ours is on&nbsp;<strong> <s>Diigo, which I find really useful because you can highlight and put&nbsp; notes on pages and share that if you want (or just save your&nbsp; highlights&#x2F;notes for yourself). That way, when people find other&nbsp; resources on the web they think are useful for the group, they&#x27;re all in&nbsp; one place--which I think is better than trying to hunt them down from a&nbsp; discussion board.</s></strong></li><li>2. I do agree that a blog aggregator would be&nbsp; best. Otherwise, people are going to have to search through the&nbsp; discussion board to find blog feeds amongst the other items in the&nbsp; discussion board. I wish I could help with this, but I don&#x27;t know&nbsp; anything about it other than what I posted earlier from Alan Levine.</li><li>3.&nbsp; In ETMOOC there is also a <strong><s>twitter list that people can subscribe to. </s></strong>I&nbsp; think they created it on the &quot;etmooc&quot; twitter profile itself, by just&nbsp; adding people&#x27;s twitter accounts to a list. See here: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter&#x2e;com&#x2F;etmooc&#x2F;lists">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;etmooc&#x2F;lists</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this would take a good deal of work on the facilitators&#x27; part, to&nbsp; set up a separate twitter account and add people&#x27;s profiles to the list,&nbsp; and perhaps you would rather participants just add each other&nbsp; themselves, and that&#x27;s fine. Just thought I&#x27;d mention another way in&nbsp; case it sounds good. It would allow participants to just subscribe to&nbsp; the lists created centrally (though they&#x27;d have to resubscribe each time&nbsp; a new person was added to the list, which is a downside). You could,&nbsp; alternatively, have them send a tweet to an account asking to be added&nbsp; to a list, rather than hunting for their twitter handles in the&nbsp; discussion board. Of course, feel free to ignore if this sounds like too&nbsp; much work or wouldn&#x27;t really make things easier for the participants!</li><li><strong>4.&nbsp; <s>On each week&#x27;s page, I&#x27;m not sure, as a layperson, what the&nbsp; &quot;discussion&quot; refers to. Does it mean that&#x27;s what will be discussed in&nbsp; the synchronous meeting, and&#x2F;or what people might discuss in the&nbsp; discussion board, and&#x2F;or what they could blog about?
