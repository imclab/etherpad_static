<body>Hi everyone<br><br>I am writing to ask for feedback on a few changes I made to the website. You are someone who has been involved in P2PU for a while and your feedback will drive the next round of improvements.<br><br>Before we start I need to mention that more than one thing changed on the new site. The first thing that you will notice is the new overall look (driven by the CSS framework)! But I&#x27;m not looking for feedback on that right now.<br><br>The thing that I would like feedback on is the new Course UX.<br><br>The new course UX is our attempt to take all the good things from courses&#x2F;challenges&amp;groups and combine them into a single thing we call a course that supports all the good features from the 3 previous types.<br><br>It&#x27;s actually rather easy to know if you are giving feedback on the new course UX or something else. If the URL starts with <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha.p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;</a> then you are in the right place!<br><br>So, after all these words, lets get started. Log in using &quot;user-1&quot; with &quot;password&quot;. Head over to <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;create">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha.p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;create</a> and create a new course. The help text in the column on the right hand side needs to be updated, so suggestions would be welcome.<br><br>After that, you will be redirected to your course. This is you course landing page. From here on I don&#x27;t want to give too much direction. Just go ahead and create a course, play around, and let me know how it went.<br><br>To record your feedback, you can create a etherpad and email me a link or if you want to be creative, go ahead. Please don&#x27;t look at other feedback. We will share everything afterward.<br><br>Thanks for your time!<br><br>Cheers<br>Dirk<br><br></body>
