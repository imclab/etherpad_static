As a user, I don&#x27;t want this be a burden, but it should be super obvious (like the +1 or Like feature in G+ and FB). I&#x27;ve added +1 for the ones I like best. [CV: what is the parallel here? how is +1 a peer assessment? I just used it to indicate which of the badges I like. Ooo @.@]</li><li>PS: A more conceptual comment. I like the way that del.icio.us turned selfish action (I book-mark because want to remember this link) into something that had meaning within the community. If users &quot;bookmark&quot; or &quot;star&quot; posts by other users, that might be a more meaningful measure of how much they really like that post (rather than asking them to say they like it by giving a badge). The badge could then be automated - if you get 5 +1 clicks, you get the badge. [CV: I like this idea, should check how easy it is to do]</li><li>comments for Team Player Badge<ul class="bullet"><li>I feel like there&#x27;s some overlap between Team Player&#x2F;Helpful Feedback.If you&#x27;re giving Helpful Feeback, that&#x27;s being a Team Player, yes?</li><li>Agree that there is some overlap, but also differences. For me a team player (maybe &quot;community builder&quot;) is the person that makes sure everyone is ok, calms tempers when necessary, etc.</li><li>Yes -Vanessa&nbsp; these badges both exist in the current pilot and to become a team player you have to own the helpful feedback badge. I think it is ok for them to be similar as long as they are somehow connected. Maybe we could make them become a bit more distinct, I was thinking that team player really appeals when you are having a team assignment.</li></ul></li><li>comments about Nice Share Badge<ul class="bullet"><li>[Really like this. Is there some overlap between Nice Share and Social Legend? Isn&#x27;t contributing relevant and interesting material the skill measured in both?]</li><li>[PS: Could only give the option to award this badge in the context of comments&#x2F;posts that contain a hyperlink]</li><li>[CV: Nice Share is about hsaring links, Social Legelnd is about being an active user. &#x2F; yes PS]</li></ul></li><li>comments for Wave Badge<ul class="bullet"><li>PS[I like the idea of encouraging users to start contacting each other - but not sure this is a &quot;badge&quot; ... if 30 users &quot;waved&quot; at me, would I have 30 badges? or just one? Not sure how this would work. ]</li><li>CV[ PS, all these badges work the same way which is to say they are accumulative, optionally they could result in levels]</li><li>Vanessa [Other suggestions: Howdy. Well Hello There! or P2PU-gram]</li></ul></li><li>for general p2pu badges stealth badges could be really powerful<ul class="bullet"><li>for giving badges to users active on the site (comments, visiting the site consistently, ....) - absolutely, these are to replace&#x2F;upgrade the ones we currently have as blue ones.</li></ul></li></ul><br><br>&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;draft under this line &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;<br><br><u>Badges awarded by&nbsp; the system (based on activity) &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; still working on this</u><br><em>These are awarded directly through the system based on activity metrics such as comments + time tracked.</em><br><br><strong>Firestarter</strong><br>Ignites conversation.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Fast and Furious </strong>(not tracking&#x2F; should be able to mark comment as &quot;question&quot; to track)<br>Measures how fast someone responds to questions<br><br><strong>The Answering Machine</strong> (not tracking)<br>Measures how many questions one answers, recognizes momentum, encourages re-engagement.<br>[I love &quot;You&#x27;re an answering MACHINE&quot;--should this be in lumps of 10?]<br>[PS: Great name, great badge and makes sense to have levels.
