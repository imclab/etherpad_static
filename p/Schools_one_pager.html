<body>P2PU Schools<br><br><br><strong>What is a P2PU School?</strong><br>A School is a learning community that commits to be stewards of a&nbsp; content area. A School runs under the core values of openness, peer&nbsp; learning and community.<br>Schools are comprised of a core group of people committing to&nbsp; organize multiple courses within a given content area, often this group&nbsp; is from an established organization.&nbsp; They identify core competencies in&nbsp; their content area and develop pathways to learning and recognition.<br><strong>Join a School</strong><br>At P2PU we have six Schools in collaboration with other initiatives:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>School of Data, Open Knowledge Foundation</li><li>School of Ed, K12 Handhelds</li><li>School of the Mathematical Future, Planet Math</li><li>School of Open, Creative Commons</li><li>School of Social Innovation, Citizen Circles</li><li>School of Webcraft, Mozilla</li></ul>You can join a School by visiting its page and signing up for its&nbsp; mailing list, taking a course or challenge, or developing your own.&nbsp; Contact the School&#8217;s organizers on that page, and let them know about&nbsp; your course or challenge, or other ways you are thinking of&nbsp; participating. Most discussion will take place on the School&#8217;s mailing&nbsp; list, where you can engage with P2PU&#8217;s community of peer learners&nbsp; directly.<br><strong>Start a School with P2PU</strong><br>If you are interested in starting a new school at P2PU that does not currently exist, feel free to propose it as a P2PU Labs project first. You can also send a note to the P2PU community mailing list to gauge interest.<br><br></body>
