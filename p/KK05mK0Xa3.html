<body>Independent Newspapers. 17 Newspapers, Community Newspaper Division, Many different departments with different training needs.&nbsp;<br><br>Jonathan is in charge of training, but it&#x27;s a huge operation and can&#x27;t do all the training internally.<br><br>How can Independent Newspaper become a culture &#x2F; company of learning? Found that difficult to implement. People are stretched at the moment. Newspapers are being hit hard by the recession and pressure from online media.&nbsp;<br><br>Decided to create an in-house training school. People who are not journalists, would get training to become journalists and at the end of the training many would be hired internally. Uses Vula (Sakai based).&nbsp;<br><br>Also runs workshops for particular communities - for example news editors. Wanted to create a forum for them to share experience and common problems. Tried to create forum for them (wikispaces).<br><br>Noticed P2PU in UCT&#x27;s list of lunch time seminars and found our course that way. Also looking at Poynter Institute - excellent courses, but not affordable for many people. Could P2PU be an alternative to that? Interested in sending Independent Newspaper people into our courses. Other option is to offer courses - how would that work in practice?<br><br>The &quot;new journalism&quot; skills are interesting, but main focus for Independent Newspapers probably hard traditional skills.<br><br>Would want to keep some courses closed (sometimes discussion include job&#x2F;company&#x2F;boss related frustrations which would not be appropriate in a public form). Other courses - for example - environmental journalism would be ok to do openly. Interesting to get people from other countries involved.&nbsp;<br><br>Also member of SANEF Training South African National Editor&#x27;s Forum. Part of the mandate is to look at covering the local government elections and providing training around that. Content would be specific for SA needs, but we could look at maybe doing something around that. As a way of running a course, we could get IDASA involved and some other people to get content.&nbsp;<br><br>TODO<br><br>Jonathan: Investigate if Environmental Journalism course could be run through P2PU. Course is complete and has run twice already. Might be a great way to start. Otherwise look at courses that cover more &quot;basic&quot; skills (like those run by the trainer in Durban - numeracy for journalists, etc.) to start with.&nbsp;<br><br>Philipp: Start conversation with broader group of journalism organizations and involve Jonathan in that initial group.&nbsp;<br><br>Bekka: Make sure to keep Jonathan in the loop with P2PU courses relevant to Jonathan.<br><br><br></body>
