No participants yet.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Ruth Rominger is one of the most active contributors to School of Ed - suspect it&#x27;s just in draft status, and will become part of SoEd in future</li><li>Paul Allison -&gt; course development has such a local aspect and I get feedback from all over the place, and I appreciate the offers, but knowing when to ask is tough.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Perhaps some clarity from P2PU on who the people who give feedback are would be useful.</li><li>Curriculum design on the secondary teaching level is really iterative - until students get in there and mess around, you never really know. I&#x27;ve put up more boilerplate stuff and am waiting until students get into it to find out.&nbsp;</li><li>But I feel like, in terms of badge development, I feel like I got key feedback at the right times.&nbsp;</li><li>Question to PA: Did you feel you were getting sufficient &#x2F; good feedback and response to your courses? Would you like more? Different feedback?&nbsp;</li><li>We also had a call with Karen and Paul walking through the curriculum that was very fruitful</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Development priorities (Dirk)<ul class="bullet"><li>CSS framework<ul class="bullet"><li>This is one of the big things we&#x27;re still busy with - we should have something to look at on alpha.p2pu.org soonish</li></ul></li><li>Course unification<ul class="bullet"><li>This is the process of merging the two</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>State of the mustard (Philipp)<ul class="bullet"><li>Nad had to put metrics work on hold</li><li>Stats for Aug slightly down compared to July, but basic metrics we track feel less and less relevant</li><li>More useful &#x2F; interesting -&gt; Mechanical MOOC 3000 signups</li><li>Hopefully in the next few weeks we&#x27;ll get more information on activity within courses, which will be more useful.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Agenda </strong><em>Core of the call. Focused on four types of conversations (invited guests, challenges you need help with, proposals you want feedback on, ideas you need collaborators for).&nbsp;</em><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Any feedback from Campus Party?<ul class="bullet"><li>There is a video -&gt; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;youtube&#x2e;com&#x2F;watch&#x3f;v&#x3d;xeMY5bw6NB4">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xeMY5bw6NB4</a></li><li>Vanessa -&gt; I spoke to Niels on Tuesday, he thought he was only going to speak for 15 minutes, but they gave him an hour, so he and Paul Osman spoke about dev on P2PU as well. He was back-to-back with the other speaker, which was a bit distracting.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Next week: course creation presentation</li></ul><br><strong>General discussion and questions</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>How does the course review process work? Is there a how-to &#x2F; guide somewhere?<ul class="bullet"><li>Only staff have permission to do reviews right now</li><li>What&#x27;s holding us back from opening it up?<ul class="bullet"><li>BK -&gt; nothing, I think. At least from a pedagogical perspective</li></ul></li><li>DU: We can manually give permission to let more people do reviews, but opening it up to everyone will require a write-up and will be some work to set up<ul class="bullet"><li>Recommend to lift restrictions</li></ul></li><li>BK -&gt; How about we create a very basic 5 point guideline<ul class="bullet"><li>Some general practices (be nice, remember not everyone speaks english, look for skills identified, what are peer interactions, etc) and also simple instruction -&gt; what you are supposed to do ie: &quot;click the review button&quot;, let people know where&#x2F;who the message comes from etc)</li><li><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make&#x2d;a&#x2d;course&#x2F;content&#x2F;bonus&#x2d;task&#x2d;playstorm&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make-a-course&#x2F;content&#x2F;bonus-task-playstorm&#x2F;</a></li><li>I&#x27;ve only reviewed courses off p2pu.org, in draft form--I&#x27;m unclear about how to do it myself</li><li>What are the things we are looking for (checklist) when we review?&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>VMG uses guidelines from course design. It&#x27;s in the &quot;create a course&quot; course.<a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make&#x2d;a&#x2d;course&#x2F;content&#x2F;bonus&#x2d;task&#x2d;playstorm&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make-a-course&#x2F;content&#x2F;bonus-task-playstorm&#x2F;</a>&nbsp; - and repurposing it would be GREAT!</li></ul></li><li>Leah -&gt; VMG and I have looked at this rubric and talked about it a lot.&nbsp;</li><li>People need more guidance about using the technology within the system - like how to place a YouTube embed so that it doesn&#x27;t look weird, and how to use graphics to unify the theme of their course, we&#x27;ve talked about personal branding, and it can be really simple, but people don&#x27;t know about them.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>PA -&gt; I think it might be useful to help people know how to get in contact with other people. And also it&#x27;s important to let people know that it&#x27;s okay to open it up before it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; (if a course is ever really &quot;done&quot;)</li><li>BK&#x2F;VMG to build basic course review rubrik</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br></body>
