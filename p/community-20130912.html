Of these projects 159 were challenges, 132 were study groups, and 77 were courses. About 85% of these projects were in English and 12% in Spanish (with less than 3% in other languages).</li><li>It was found that 6,483 members returned to P2PU at least once after account creation (approximately 16% of all registered members). This implies that that the majority of members (approximately 85%) created accounts and never again engaged with the community.&nbsp;</li><li>Of the 6,483 members of P2PU who logged in at least once more after creating an account, 4,730 (73%) have signed up to be an organizer, participant, or follower of at least one learning project. This suggests that of P2PU members who do return to the site, a substantial number attempt to become active members in projects by organizing a project or signing up to be a participant.</li><li>The majority of these learning groups were small. The median number of participants in study groups was three members and the median in courses was five members.</li><li>The detailed logging of tasks provides some nuanced ways to conceptualize and observe persistence and engagement. For example, challenges in P2PU had an average of 4.67 learning tasks that members were asked to complete (Table 2). On average, members reported completing roughly half of the available tasks (2.24 average number of tasks completed per adopter).</li><li>We thought that very few of the social features (Like &quot;follow) were being used, but in actual fact, the these features were being very well used.&nbsp;</li><li>People scared of Identity theft regarding assignments- interesting!</li></ul><br>Assessment research - (VMG)<br>RPA Journal<br>Core issues:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Identity fraud</li><li>Scalability</li></ul><br><br>Meyer: Cheating and MOOCs<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;rpajournal&#x2e;com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp&#x2d;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF3&#x2e;pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rpajournal.com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF3.pdf</a><br>Problem: MOOCs are ripe for cheating, and so instructors don&#x27;t trust them.<br>Proposed Solution: have a lot of test questions and use item response theory to figure out how hard they are to equalize for adaptive learning.<br>P2PU: Seem to think cheating is a big problem--if you look at students as numbers, it might be. Change the learning activity so that assessing is learning, and cheating evaporates as a problem.<br><br>Balfour: Collaborative Peer Review<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;rpajournal&#x2e;com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp&#x2d;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF4&#x2e;pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rpajournal.com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF4.pdf</a><br>Problem: MOOCs at scale pose more material to be assessed than a team of instructors have bandwidth to assess.<br>Solution: Coursera&#x27;s version of Calibrated Peer Review:&nbsp; &quot;For Koller and Ng, &#8220;calibrated peer review&#8221; is a specific form of peer review in which students are trained on a particular scoring rubric for an assignment using practice essays before they begin the peer review process.&quot;<br>&quot;Lastly, a few studies suggest that structured, computer-regulated peer evaluation in specific situations may be more beneficial to students than just feedback on their writing (Heise, Palmer-Judson, &amp; Su, 2002; Likkel, 2012). &quot;<br>P2PU:&nbsp;<br>Students don&#x27;t usually trust peer review--takes some convincing that peer review is relevant. Can frame in terms of &quot;not a test--relevant to your life&quot;<br>We can reframe the discussion about scale--learning has a distinctly affective&#x2F;emotive dimension. Leaners must develop relationships in order to trust each other enough to assess--they must know each other&#x27;s online presence and respect their point of view. Only if we build upon *relationships* will peer learning scale, in a networked way. CPR does this by training students to give feedback first, to calibrate.&nbsp;<br><br>Sandeen, Assessment in the New MOOC world<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;rpajournal&#x2e;com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp&#x2d;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF1&#x2e;pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rpajournal.com&#x2F;dev&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;SF1.pdf</a><br>Problem: MOOCs put the issue of assessment front and center, no longer an add-on in course design<br>Shift from inputs (curriculum, seat time, quality instructors) to outcomes (competency-based) evaluation--&gt;opportunity for assessment&nbsp;<br>Solution: assessment experimentation &amp; ways to secure authentication&#x2F;identity<br>Opportunity in the humanities: &quot;The majority of MOOCs offered for credit are in STEM disciplines. It will be interesting to see new developments in large scale online assessments for classes in the humanities and the arts where multiple choice exam questions are not always the most effective or accepted assessment method.&quot;<br><br>WHAT TO DO ABOUT RESEARCH AT P2PU<br><br>- Research going on at P2PU<br>- Research guidelines for P2PU<br>- Data Policy<br>- Research that backs up our projects<br>- Research in this space<br><br>We can put in parking lot for next week: What is future of info.p2pu.org<br><br>Sites we like: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;hastac&#x2e;org&#x2F;collections&#x2F;badges&#x2d;learning&#x2d;research">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hastac.org&#x2F;collections&#x2F;badges-learning-research</a><br><br><br></body>
