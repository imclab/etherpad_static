<body>Intro paragraph:&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u>What makes a good challenge (and why)?</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple setup, complex problem: </strong>The challenge uses a simple setup that requires learners to find the solution to a complex problem. <em>For example, in the &quot;Bring it all together&quot;&nbsp; challenge learners have to create a portfolio site (simple setup) but the problem they have to solve has many layers (complex) ; they have to sketch, design and develop wire frames to build their own site.</em> In doing so learners find meaning in taking the tasks that will help them solve the hard problem they are faced with.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Taking on a role: </strong>learners take on an identity or a multiple set of identities such as&nbsp; programmer, collaborator, activist, ice cream lover. In so doing they become committed to the space and the community in which the&nbsp; complex learning challenge is situated.?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a &quot;need to know&quot;: </strong>The challenge is meaningful for the learner audience. There is a need for them to master the skills required to complete the challenge. For example there is a personal motivation for the learners, such as creating your own portfolio site, or a community related one, such as leveling up and becoming a Guru&#x2F;Mentor or winning a competition among the community, and even a fun factor such as a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge.&nbsp; A need to know could be designed as a combination of some&#x2F;all of the above. By having a &#8220;need to know&#8221;&nbsp; learners find the challenge meaningful and personally fulfilling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Clear goals:</strong>&nbsp; the challenge has a clear overall goal, such as building a portfolio. A challenge goal can consist of smaller goals or combinations, such as building a portfolio site, winning badges,&nbsp; getting community credit and so forth. In doing so learners have a clear set of expectations of what they need to accomplish by the end of the challenge.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Receiving feedback &#8220;just in time&#8221; and &#8220;on demand&#8221;</strong>: Learners receive feedback on their actions as they progress through the challenge. <em>For example, in the Better,Faster,Stronger&nbsp; challenge, the learner get&#x27;s feedback on the time taken for his&#x2F;her&nbsp; portfolio content to load.</em> By providing feedback either &#8220;just in time&#8221;, right when learners need and can use it, or &#8220;on demand&#8221;, that is, when the learner feels a need for it and can make good use of it, the learning process is customized to the learner&#8217;s needs and pace.{ref. Gee, J.P}.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Smartools: </strong>By completing a challenge and obtaining a badge a learner unlocks certain smartools.&nbsp; A smartool is something a learner can use again and again in other challenges.<em>For example, Firebug (if Firebug was to be unlocked as a tool after completing challenge x) is a type of smartool.</em>&nbsp; In doing so learners connect the skills they have gained to actual tools they can use and master.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>There is risk-taking and exploration: </strong>Learners are encouraged to take risks, explore, and try new things (trial and error). <em>For example, in the MishMash challenge you have to?create grids to lay out your work and there might be several sizes of grids that you can create, so during the process you might tinker with many grid sizes (trial), make a couple of ugly layouts(error) until you find the one that works best</em>. In doing so learners feel safe to try new things and fail multiple times before mastering a skill.<br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balanced scaffolding: </strong>scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a challenge that, if too difficult, could prevent them from moving forward.&nbsp; However, it&#x27;s important not to build in so much scaffolding that users can get through the challenge without actually learning anything {ref. Hussain,Taib}. In doing so, the learner feels the challenge tasks are &#8221;doable,&#8221; but increasingly challenging.{ concept of Flow, chart here <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;bit&#x2e;ly&#x2F;qXjL7X"><u>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;qXjL7X</u></a><u>}</u>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of agency:</strong> Learners feel a real sense of agency and control over what they are learning and doing in the challenge.?<em>For example, there could be an ability to edit some challenges and remix them or a requirement to create your own challenge after completing this first course&#x2F;quest&#x2F;mission.</em> In doing so learners get personally invested in their learning.<br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many solutions to the same problem:</strong>&nbsp; different users can solve the same problem in different ways.? Being&nbsp; able to compare the different solutions is equally important. (this concept ties to &quot;Replayability&quot;, see below). In doing so learners understand that there are no wrong or right answers and can get inspired by the solutions given by their peers to the same problem.<br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun &amp; Replayability: </strong>the challenges are *so* enjoyable that users will &quot;re-play&quot; certain ones that lead to different outcomes or allow them to pledge higher expertise (maybe a guru version of a badge). <em>Adding a layer of community competition to this fact, such as a &#x27;code-off&#x27; in the I&lt;3 command line challenge for example, increases the replayability of the challenge.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment is embedded: </strong>evaluations of how the learner is doing are happening as part of the challenge, rather than after the fact. <em>For example during the&nbsp; &#8220;Marking up the world around you&#8221; challenge, learners could be assessed by the look of the world they have created.</em><br><br><u>Common Pitfalls:</u> Challenges are not connected to each other,&nbsp; assessment is added after the fact, learning is assumed to be content focused (vs deep learning skills such as problem solving, collaboration) etc.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></body>
