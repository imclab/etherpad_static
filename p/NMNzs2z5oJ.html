<body>I am applying for the Quaker Center residential internship in nonprofit management because I feel a leading to dedicate my life and efforts to activities that enrich our culture and society. I have been working for non-profit organizations for the last five years and have learned about processes and activities such as&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>fundraising,&nbsp;</li><li>event planning and management,&nbsp;</li><li>community outreach,&nbsp;</li><li>communications campaigns and social media,&nbsp;</li><li>constituent relationships management,&nbsp;</li><li>the process of incorporating not-profit organizations,&nbsp;</li><li>federal 501(c) applications process,&nbsp;</li><li>and daily activities including directing phone calls.</li></ul><br>Additional to general management activities, I have been specializing in Free and Open Source Software as used for organizations and people in the social profit sector. Most recently, I have been carrying out applied research as a New Media Intern at the Sierra Friends Center (Woolman Semester). I have been active on a number of tasks and projects here at Woolman including a campus-wide wireless network deployment, a website upgrade that brings <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;woolman&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;woolman.org</a> to the forefront of what Free Software and Open Standards have to offer, and general community technical support such as skill-sharing.<br><br>I look forward to the diverse skill set and challenges that the Quaker Center internship will offer. I am specifically eager to learn more about database management, environmental stewardship, workshop facilitation, promotions, and constituent outreach. I am also drawn to the beauty and majesty of the forest that surrounds the Quaker Center and will eagerly embark on the project to create a species identification booklet.<br><br>I am fairly new to Quakerism having only been attending weekly meetings here at Woolman for the better part of a year. I appreciate the opportunities to sit in mindful reflection, listening for the small voice of insight in my otherwise &#8220;hyper-focused&#8221; week. I feel that I have been drawn to Quakerism for quite some time before arriving at Woolman and am only beginning to recognize to some of the meaningful coincidences that have guided and continue to guide my meandering sojourn. Some of the challenges that I have experienced in the community of Friends have revolved around the process of drawing out the truth that exists between all members in regards to collective decision making.<br><br>I am comfortable living with simple accommodations. I have been living, with few possessions, at the Woolman Semester for nearly a year and had been working to reduce my environmental footprint for a couple of years prior. Living at Woolman is fairly removed from town and&#x2F;or city life.&nbsp;<br><br>The most appealing aspect of living at Woolman, and subsequently the Quaker Center, is that of being surrounded by a beautiful and natural habitat. I have frequently enjoyed listening to the sounds of the wind, birds, and other animals. There is a grounding quality in nature that serves to remind me of my place in this world. I appreciate the power and flexibility of flowing water and frequently pause to reflect near brooks, rivers, and other bodies of water.<br><br>One additional thing that I would like to mention is my dedication to the study with learners from around the globe with the intent to contribute back to the growing body of freely available educational and cultural resources.<br><br></body>
