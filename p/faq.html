<body>P2PU FAQ<br><br>Example<br><br>Q: I just want to talk to a human, where do I go for help?<br>A: You can email help@p2pu.org and one of our volunteers will get back to you. Please read through the rest of this FAQ first though, we&#x27;ve tried to answer most common questions here.<br>[Need to set up help@p2pu.org]<br><br>Explanation: I talked with a few users and they don&#x27;t know where to go if they want to contact someone who is very involved with P2PU. Pointing people to the community list doesn&#x27;t scale<br>We need a better About &gt; People page - This should represent staff, board and school owners.<br><br>====================<br><br><br>Q: Do all course materials need to be freely and openly available?<br>A: All materials referenced in a study group or course need to be available to anyone legally at no charge. Even if materials you link to are not openly licensed, as long as anyone can get them free of charge that is usually ok. In some rare instances, study groups have to make use of materials that are not freely available (e.g. a literature course that includes a book that is currently under copyright) but those are the exception.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>PREVIOUSLY: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;webcraft&#x2F;school&#x2d;webcraft&#x2d;frequently&#x2d;asked&#x2d;questions">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;webcraft&#x2F;school-webcraft-frequently-asked-questions</a><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;faqs">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;faqs</a><br><br></body>
