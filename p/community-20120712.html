Maybe this has changed, and the process is too complicated for what we need it to be. This could be a very simple, easy way for creators to get feedback.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Problems: Can&#x27;t see any kind of archive or &quot;outbox&quot; of messages that have been sent.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body>
