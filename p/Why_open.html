<body><strong>= Why Open? course =&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The community has brought up the importance of a course or courses on not only how to implement open practices, but on why open practices are important, eg:<br><br>&quot;To my impression, the philosophy should not only rest on the 2 mission parts&nbsp; &quot;tell what open means&quot; and &quot;teach how to do that&quot;, but also rest on part&nbsp; 3 &quot;show why open is better when and for whom&quot;. From years of experience around &quot;open everything&quot; I&#x27;d say that promoting open is not so much&nbsp; about telling people how to do it, but to tell them why to do it. Once&nbsp; they understand the Why they tend to find pleasure in teaching&nbsp; themselves the How. This is not about convincing by being evangelic or&nbsp; ideological about open, but rather about giving good examples for why&nbsp; open is different, where it improves what and how that relates to almost everybody&#x27;s life.&quot; - John Weitzmann<br><br><strong>Communicating with the participants</strong><br>Jane can export emails once signup closes Aug. 4 - I&#x27;ll send you Aug 4 evening or Aug 5 morning<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Say that they receiving this email bc they signe up for X course.

Should we add some of those?&nbsp;</li><li><s>I had an idea of maybe having a Twitter chat once a week during the course. I&#x27;ve done these quite a bit in other courses, and it&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve gotten to know a good number of people. We just come up with 6-8 questions for an hour, and people discuss on twitter. Works quite well, though you do need a critical mass of about 8-10 people for it to not be too slow.</s> Yes, let&#x27;s do it. Christina and Jeannette can run these.</li><li><s>In section 3, below, we talked about possibly having a Wikipedia activity or&nbsp; two--we need to discuss that and include in the course. </s>Christina will email Pete about this</li><li><s>Need to find a picture for the course on P2PU</s>-<s>-Jane will do this</s></li><li><s>We have small groups for one section of the course (doing open practice), but not for any other activity. Should we ask them to do something else in their groups, like maybe read blog posts from each other and comment? But I&#x27;d like them to read blog posts from others too, not just those in their group.&nbsp;</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I think what we have them doing is fine. We should encourage them to read everyone&#x27;s blog posts (as they willa ll be aggregated by then right?) throughout.+1</s></li></ul></li><li><s>Should we have a way for people to share links, such as a social bookmarking group? I can set up a Diigo group for the course, and I think it can be outputted onto the WP site that has the blog hub (on a different page of the site). At least, people can have the bookmarks in their own library if they&#x27;re part of the group. The thing is, it&#x27;s one more thing to sign up for (you have to have a Diigo account), and we&#x27;re already asking them to do a lot for a three-week course if they&#x27;re new to all this (set up blog, Twitter, G+). But it&#x27;s a better way to share links than just in the discussion area, where they can get lost. What do you think?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I think nix the Diigo, but maybe link to it as an optional bookmarking tool</s></li><li>Diigo may be asking too much. I still think an etherpad would help with this. We can ask the participants to categorize the links</li></ul></li><li><s>A friend of mine running a MOOC in the UK just told me that if we use Google Hangouts, then people in several countries can&#x27;t participate, b&#x2F;c YouTube is blocked in those places. I don&#x27;t know if Skype would be any better in that regard? Can you get 10 people on a video skype call like you can for google hangout? Just a thought, to try to open up access as much as possible! I realize Twitter may have similar issues.</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>If we do use Google Hangouts, how should we find people&#x27;s G+ accounts to invite them to the hangouts?&nbsp; Should we create a G+ group for the course that people add themselves&nbsp; to, or can we find them through their email address? Though they may use&nbsp; a different email address for G+ than what they registered with. Just searching for names on G+ is difficult, given how many people there are with similar names!</s></li><li>We will have an etherpad where people can RSVP with the gmails and where we will take notes during the call. We can also just post the link to the hangout once it has started - that way anyone can join.&nbsp;</li><li>This also allows those who cant join the hangout to partcipate via etherpad and watch hangout &quot;on air&quot; or the recording after the fact</li><li>If G+, there are four facilitators,&nbsp; which means that we are almost half the class. Depending on sign-ups, should we plan for at least two of us to watch the hangout afterwards? Yes; I was thinking even just one facilitator per hangout, but we could have two.</li><li>Ok, so we could post the link to the hangout on the etherpad. I don&#x27;t know how to set up a pad for p2pu that we can use for the course; Jane, can you do that and post a link on the &quot;about&quot; page to the &quot;main&quot; pad on which we can post links to any other pads we create?</li></ul></li><li><s>Speaking of Twitter, I&#x27;m wondering now if we need both synchronous video sessions and Twitter chats (even though I suggested the Twitter chats!). Reasons I&#x27;m now thinking to drop it:</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I&#x27;m not sure what we&#x27;re doing with the synchronous video sessions. Are they mostly for having discussions about what we&#x27;re doing&#x2F;learning? That&#x27;s what Twitter would be for too, and I&#x27;m not sure we need both?&nbsp;</s></li><li><s>People who are new to Twitter may not be able to participate because their tweets won&#x27;t show up in search yet. It takes awhile for Twitter to accept that new accounts are from real users, and people need to Tweet a bit first. So this could be a problem.</s></li><li><s>We&#x27;re already asking participants to do a lot in this course, so two synchronous things a week may be too much! Plus, learning how to use Twitter for the first time, plus Google+, plus create a blog...it would be a lot for people new to this stuff to do for a very short course. If we had an extra week just to learn the tools, that would be different.</s></li><li><s>I&#x27;m realizing how busy I am in August and I&#x27;m not sure I can participate in all these things. So now I&#x27;m suggesting either dropping the Twitter or just having two chats instead of, say, four.&nbsp;</s></li><li><s>What do you think?</s></li><li><s>I&#x27;m fine with dropping Twitter - but it sounded like Jeanette might want to host that. It&#x27;s just another optional venue for folks to participate -- we just have to make it clear that not all of it is required</s></li><li><s>I think the required things are the blog posts, doing the open practice, and providing feedback for each other. The hangouts, etc. people can join and those who can&#x27;t can watch the recordings later.</s></li><li><s>I can host the twitter chat as an option, but I agree that participants might already be signing up for blogs and google+.</s></li><li><s>Okay, so how about if we say we&#x27;ll have Twitter chats and they&#x27;re optional? I can do one or two, and Jeannette can do the others?</s></li></ul></li><li>How should we split up the synchronous sessions in terms of who is hosting and planning them? Each one of us takes one? There are four.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Sure I&#x27;m happy to do it that way.&nbsp;</li><li>I am fine with that also.</li><li>Any preferences on which one you&#x27;d like to take, anyone? I don&#x27;t care, myself.</li></ul></li><li>My UK friend noted that if we do a poll for days&#x2F;times for the synchronous sessions, then if most people are in N. America, the times will all be good for N. Americans and the other parts of the world may not be able to participate. Once we get registrants, maybe we make sure there&#x27;s no one for whom all synch sessions are in the middle of the night? So, for example, if there&#x27;s someone in Japan, we make sure we have one during the day in that time zone. Otherwise, we&#x27;ll end up with just people in the Americas being able to participate, perhaps, if they&#x27;re the majority.<ul class="bullet"><li>Yeah - it will depend on who signs up. I&#x27;m flexible.</li><li>I am also flexible</li></ul></li><li><s>Should we make Parts 3 and 4 of the course just one part, to avoid confusion b&#x2F;c they&#x27;re both for the same week?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>nah. too much info one page - i like how it is clearly delineated now</s></li></ul></li><li><s>What should they need to do for the first badge, the open practices badge? And once we decide, can someone please write up on that badge page what it is they need to do? And also write up what they need to do on the final project badge page too?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I added this for both badges&nbsp; Thanks, Jane!</s></li></ul></li><li><s>Should we think about capping the number of people who can join? I say this only because I don&#x27;t have a ton of time, and we may get a lot of emails asking for help. Also because I&#x27;ll have to add in all the blog RSS URLs by hand, and that will take a very long time if there are lots of people. I was thinking maybe 50 maximum. What do you think?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>Sure - but I doubt we&#x27;ll get that many people. But we should say that up front on the about page - that it will be capped at 50 if so. Ok, I&#x27;ll put that on the &quot;About&quot; page.</s></li></ul></li><li><s>Christina will&nbsp; set up a Word Press blog on own domain with a blog aggregator so all&nbsp; blog posts will show up in one place (actually, a friend is doing it b&#x2F;c he has unlimited sites he can set up on his hosting service; he&#x27;ll do it this weekend). We can also set up an etherpad&nbsp; that people could post blog links to so others can find the blogs that&nbsp; way in case the aggregator isn&#x27;t working. Who will set up the pad and where will it be hosted? I&#x27;ve created a couple of Google doc pages with tutorials on various web tools (see the &quot;about&quot; and &quot;final project&quot; sections of the course), so maybe we should just make a Gdoc page for this too? I just used Gdoc b&#x2F;c I&#x27;m so used to it. I could transfer my help pages over to etherpad if we want to use that instead.</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>Gdoc is fine - as long as you make the docs compeltely public and publicly editable so people can edit without an account&nbsp; Okay, done! I made them viewable and editable to anyone with the link, w&#x2F;o needing to sign in.</s></li></ul></li><li><s>If&nbsp; we wanted to make some parts of week 1 required and some more optional,&nbsp; how about making the second blog post optional? We could ask them to do&nbsp; the first and then read the stuff after that, and then they could also&nbsp; do another blog post if they want?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I think we should nix the blog post in D. and instead have folks just respond to the questions posed&nbsp; So maybe respond to the questions in the discussion area instead of a blog post, or in a google hangout?</s></li><li><s>If we make anything optional, we should have a clear OPTIONAL section at bottom.</s></li><li><s>I agree that D should be deleted. Perhaps, we should set up the assignments for each week under two major headings as main and optional. Therefore, D can be placed under optional.&nbsp;</s></li><li><s>Ok, sounds good. I made part D of the first section of the course optional</s></li></ul></li><li><s>I think section 2 is quite a bit of stuff for one week, but I also think it&#x27;s really important and I&#x27;m not sure I want to make any of it optional. Should we leave it as is and this will be a heavy week? Or make something optional? </s><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;588&#x2F;content&#x2F;1262&#x2F;"><s>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;courses&#x2F;588&#x2F;content&#x2F;1262&#x2F;</s></a><ul class="bullet"><li><s>Section 2 is asking participants to do five separate activities, which I agree is too many. If we make D in section 1 optional, then section 1 will have three assignments. Perhaps, we can make sure to keep the same number of assignments per week for consistency. In section 2, we can have students learn about CC licences, brainstorm about open activity, and then participate in an open activity as the main activity and the additional&nbsp; blog post and comment as optional.</s></li></ul></li><li><s>For section 3, the optional blog post might be a main activity to help participants synthesise what they think about the stories of openness they viewed</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>I agree--I like that blog post in section 3! However, note that that week we&#x27;re also doing section 4, so that means two blog posts that week, which is a fair bit.</s></li></ul></li><li><s>Also, in terms of having participants comment on each other&#x27;s blogs, are we going to state that we would like each comment to be on a different blog, so that they don&#x27;t only comment on the same two blogs?</s><ul class="bullet"><li><s>Yes, that&#x27;s a good idea. I had that in there originally, but then I started making some things optional, etc., and I think it got lost.
