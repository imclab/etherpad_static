<body>Here are how the POERUP plans are shaping up. For discussion. No worries Chris, we are going ahead. It may be that we need two separate rooms in the afternoon at least. In general terms, for the morning POERUP prefers a room close to the rest of the conference.<br><br><ol class="number"><li>On <strong>afternoon of Monday 25 March and morning of Thursday 28 March</strong> POERUP holds its actual <strong>project meeting</strong>, with POERUP partner dinner on Wednesday evening (with guests). Could do our partner meeting in Leicester but much better all round to do it in Nottingham. So the actual POERUP project meeting takes place before and after, not during, OER13. (But will need advice on rooms, Chris.)</li><li>All POERUP meeting attendees &#8211; at least 10 from the POERUP partners - are asked to register for OER13. Need to check on bulk rates. Can get you a list, Chris.</li><li>Within OER13, there is no POERUP activity on day 1.</li><li>On day 2 we avoid clashes with keynotes.</li><li>From 1100-1330 we have three POERUP presentations.</li><li>Morning Presentation 1 - One (or two) on countries we have covered which have OER interest but are not covered in the main conference &#8211; currently we suggest Mexico and perhaps a Scandinavian country &#8211; we have a good South Africa report but it would cost money to get the speaker here (not ruled out, we have some money for speakers and delegates).</li><li>MP2 &#8211; how to use Social Network Analysis for POERUP (and other) OER Community case studies &#8211; presented by expert from Dutch Ou.</li><li>MP3 (unless a country report) &#8211; some other aspect of POERUP &#8211; may well be global map of OER initiatives (as per Susan D&#8217;Antoni report)</li><li>One or two POERUP people will go to the ALT OER SIG at lunch &#8211; but what we really want is a UK-specific group to consult &#8211; any ideas? There is a budget for that too. (Could just ask the others there NOT to comment.)</li><li>In the afternoon,<strong> 1.30-2.00 Presentation on CommOER</strong> &#8211; does Peter want a <strong>practical workshop</strong> as well? one group could move to another room</li><li>2.00-3.15&nbsp; POERUP IAC (international Advisory Committee) &#8211; for policy people: How POERUP sees OER policies in the light of policies for IT&#x2F;ICT in universities and schools.</li><li>3.15 everyone joins main conference, so can attend plenary, farewell session etc</li></ol>&nbsp;<br>It may be that Pete wants a lot more time than this for CommOER and it may be that we cannot avoid a clash with plenaries but my approach at present is that POERUP staff (and any International Advisory Committee people not expected otherwise at OER13) book into OER13 &#8211; we have an allowance that can go to delegate travel and subsistence.<br><br><br><strong>Definitions:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>POERUP IAC (10 people who wouldn&#x27;t otherwise come) (prioritizing teachers)</li><li>10 POERUP staff</li></ul><br>1. Who would attend a CommOER session?<br><br>2. How long would the session be?<br><br>3. What would the goals be?<br><br><br><br>1:30 to 2:00: presentation on&nbsp;<br><br></body>
