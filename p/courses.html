<body>Question (Philipp): Great notes! What are the concrete next steps&#x2F;tasks?<br><br><br><strong>Problems:</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>It will be hard to implement rounds if course creation process fails users</li><li>&quot;Create a course&quot; is hard to find, although several pathways exist</li><li>The &quot;form&quot; style of creating a course is not conducive to the process</li><li>It isnt obvious how you state that your course is not yet &quot;open&quot;; you might not want it discoverable until you have put together the content etc.</li><li>The most important decision you make is selecting whether you want to create a course, challenge or group and on th current form this is not a prominent decision.</li></ul><br><strong>Hacks</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Forgo form style creation, start with</li><li>Create:<ul class="bullet"><li>choose Study Group, Course, Challenge (PLP and Mentorship TBA)</li><li>you click save draft to work on your course&#x2F;challenge&#x2F;group until you are ready</li><li>you click &quot;publish&quot; or &quot;Open for signup&quot; to indicate that this course is ready for participants to join.<ul class="bullet"><li>this should trigger a mail to Staff so they can promote the course, contact the organiser etc.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><br><strong><u>Additional Ideas</u></strong><br><br><strong>Create a course completion meter?</strong><br>Possible platform development that could support implementing this is discussed at: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;464">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;464</a>.<br><br><br><strong>Outline of Create a Course infographic:</strong> <em>(your mission should you choose to accept: what&#x27;s the catchy phrase or even word that encapsulates each main header?)</em><br><br><strong>0) Talk to your friends!</strong><br>&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; This is a peer course - what does that mean?&nbsp; It&#x27;s important that you&nbsp; think about how you plan to involve your peers as collaborators in every&nbsp; step of planning a course.&nbsp; This may be different at first from how you&nbsp; remember doing things in school!&nbsp; That&#x27;s why task one is talking to&nbsp; your friends.<br>&nbsp;--&gt; Recruit co-organizers - courses that do this are generally a lot more likely to succeed<br>&nbsp;--&gt; Talk to potential participants and learn about their ideas &#x2F; needs<br>&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; Consult your friends, past organizers, teachers, and whatever else you&nbsp; have at your disposal (google, your grandmother&#x27;s national geographic&nbsp; collection, etc.).&nbsp; Don&#x27;t be afraid to cold-call people with interesting&nbsp; curriculum you might be interested in.<br><br><strong>1) Develop a clear learning goal for the course</strong><br>&nbsp;--&gt; Have a distinct set of learning outcomes<br>&nbsp;--&gt; Discuss what type of course this is (a studio, a discussion group, skill building, etc.?)<br>&nbsp;--&gt; Discuss why you are all here: are you just getting interested in this topic or have you been studying it for years?<br>&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; Discuss what could be a really good way to complete the course -&nbsp; producing a creative product together, holding an event, creating a blog&nbsp; post to tell your story.&nbsp; How will you know when you&#x27;re done?<br><br><strong>2) Break the larger goal down into tasks</strong><br>&nbsp;--&gt; Can be individual or group, discussions, activities, or project work, etc.<br>&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; In collaboratively-designed courses, all should have some input first&nbsp; and then tasks should be whittled down to only those that someone is&nbsp; taking ownership of.<br>&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; Don&#x27;t neglect or underestimate the social dynamic - chemistry and fun&nbsp; are important.&nbsp; What is the reason people want to come back each week?<br><br><strong>3) Illustrate these ideas by having an awesome course page</strong><br>&nbsp;--&gt; A picture<br>&nbsp;--&gt; A good title (hook)<br>&nbsp;--&gt; A good description of learning goals, input hours, and style of communication<br>&nbsp;--&gt; A schedule<br>&nbsp;--&gt; Make a decision about the style of signup (optional)<br><br>Now you&#x27;re ready to promote!<br><br><br></body>
