<body>Hi there!<br><br>This email is a long time in the making. I first visited DR back in 2003, near the end of undergrad. I was so young at the time, but I loved the experience. I&#x27;ve been a subscriber to the newsletter since before that visit, and I was always pouring over the website, anticipating each new addition.<br><br>Almost a decade later, here I am pouring over your website. Having completed a few more years of schooling (masters degree in information) and committed my life to my partner and our first child, I recently moved to one of the busiest places in the US (San Francisco) for a job I was, and in many ways still am, very passionate about, but we are now at a point in our lives where we are searching for our true home.<br><br>Of course, Dancing Rabbit has always been on my mind. The weekly emails, the memories of that awesome week I spent there with an old friend. I remember helping Ted and Sarah cob their house, inside and out, laying the first layer of cinder blocks for Bob&#x27;s new house, enjoying a drum circle by the pond, and of course skinny dipping in the pond then running to the grain trailer sauna. A perfect week.<br><br>This holiday season, Carrie, Rowan (1 year this month), and I are steadfastly exploring homesteading opportunities, but, having always been communally-oriented in our housing searches, we can only imagine settling in a place that has, or could have, a true community.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, this always brings me back to DR.<br><br>Long story short: Carrie, Rowan, and I would love to visit DR in 2013 with the visitor program. We&#x27;d be there at least a week, hopefully more.<br><br>Let me know when the visitor program for 2013 is ready so we can get things lined up!<br><br>Warmest regards,<br><br>Greg<br><br><br>PS: For those who might remember me: I came to DR with a buddy of similar age. We both had relatively long hair (pony-tails). I&#x27;m blond-ish; his was brown. My parents live in Hannibal, MO; he lived in central Illinois.<br><br></body>
