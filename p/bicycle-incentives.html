<body>The purpose of this research is to determine the potential carbon offset and incentives for bicycle commuting.&nbsp;<br><br>Several peer reviewed studies have been conducted on the benefits and hazards of bicycle commuting. Selected research papers came from open access, peer-reviewed scientific literature and publicly funded research projects.<br><br>For every pound of gasoline combusted, 19.6 pounds of CO2 are released into the atmosphere.<br><br>The average US driver travels 3,220 miles annually in trips of short distance.<br><br>The average US driver produces 63,087 Lbs of CO2 emissions annually on local trips.<br><br>The estimated annual amount of CO2 released into our atmosphere by US drivers on short commutes comes to 6,733,295,325 tons.<br><br>Drivers in the United States alone emit enough tons of CO2 to equal the mass of 21 global, adult human populations.<br><br><br><br>Riding a bicycle for any distance has a minimal impact on the environment when compared with CO2 emissions per passenger mile of petroleum vehicles, which come out to be approximately 1 Lb per driving mile.&nbsp;<br><br>Lower carbon emissions contributes to enhanced living conditions in local communities, as well as a lower global carbon ratio (measured in parts per million).<br><br><br>This research paper was encouraged by Prof. Peter Impara.<br><br>Research assistance and proof reading graciously provided by Dennis Mills.<br><br>Data collected from the US Department of Transportation, US Environmental Protection Agency, National Institute of Health, National Institute of Standards and Technology, US Census Bureau, and several peer reviewed articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></body>
