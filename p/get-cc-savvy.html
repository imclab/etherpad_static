Now for the real test: try to explain CC licenses to a friend, family member or colleague. Think about how the person might relate to copyright and licensing - does she listen to a ton of music? Is he an avid creator of LOLcats? What key takeaways can you give them so they can explore CC on their own?&nbsp;<br><br>After you&#x27;ve had the conversation, come back here to answer the following questions and tell us anything else you found notable about the exchange. It would also be great if you shared any preparations you did prior to the conversation in the discussion section.<br>What questions did your friend ask that you couldn&#x27;t answer?<br>Did your friend raise any interesting points? Pros and cons?&nbsp;<br>Did your friend get it? Do you get it?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Task #3<br>Title: The right license for the job<br>Sub-title: How to choose the appropriate license<br>Content:&nbsp;<br><br>Choosing the right CC license for your work can be a deliberative and thoughtful process, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. We deliberate more below, but if you want to choose a license in a hurry, Creative Commons has a pretty simple tool for picking a license based on a couple of quick questions about how you&#x27;d like people to use your work.<br><br>Basically, when you&#x27;re looking to share your work with others, ask yourself: do I want to allow commercial use of my work or not, and then second, do I want to allow modifications of my work or not? If you&#x27;re not concerned about commercial use or controlling modifications of your work, then you can use the Attribution (CC BY) license. If you want to allow derivative works, but require that any derivatives also be made open, you can add the Share-Alike condition.<br><br>[Imagine the future of the work you create.] It doesn&#x27;t hurt to think a bit more deeply about what uses you want to permit and even encourage. Every creator has specific interests and levels of comfort with sharing work, so it&#x27;s important to take that into account when making a license choice. One person&#x27;s pro could be another person&#x27;s con. Creative Commons has been collecting a wide variety of examples of people in music, education, and social justice, all using CC licensing for their work: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;thepowerofopen&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepowerofopen.org&#x2F;</a>.<br><br>++ <em>&quot;A large part of embracing free culture is accepting the fact that you are forsaking control in exchange for something greater &#8211; the empowerment of the creative community.&quot;</em> The Al Jazeera Creative Common Repository hosts select broadcast quality footage that Al Jazeera has released under CC Attribution to reach a world-wide audience. <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;The&#x5f;Power&#x5f;of&#x5f;Open&#x2F;Text&#x23;Al&#x5f;Jazeera">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;The_Power_of_Open&#x2F;Text#Al_Jazeera</a><br>++ <em>&quot;The CC license was more than passive permission, I treated it very much as an active summons to remix.&quot; Robin Sloan </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;The&#x5f;Power&#x5f;of&#x5f;Open&#x2F;Text&#x23;Robin&#x5f;Sloan"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;The_Power_of_Open&#x2F;Text#Robin_Sloan</em></a><br>++ <em>&quot;If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I could still continue to teach a million people a year.&quot; Salman Khan from Khan Academy </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;The&#x5f;Power&#x5f;of&#x5f;Open&#x2F;Text&#x23;Khan&#x5f;Academy"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;The_Power_of_Open&#x2F;Text#Khan_Academy</em></a><br><br>- When CC isn&#x27;t appropriate (you don&#x27;t hold the (c), the work is PD, control and privacy are issues).<br>Much as we love CC licenses, they are not appropriate for all situations.

Then go to the Creative Commons license chooser and answer the questions. Did the license chooser choose the same license you chose? If they&#x27;re the same, huzzah!
