<body>Submitted October 19th<br><br>===================<br><br>Future Everything 2011 Festival - Submission Date 24th October 2010<br><br><strong>Title of Activity</strong><br>Peer based education:&nbsp; responsive ways to learn in the future (online and offline)<br><br><strong>Name of entrant</strong><br>Pippa Buchanan &amp; Alison Jean Cole<br><br><strong>Contact email address of entrant</strong><br>pippa.buchanan@gmail.com<br>alisonjean.cole@gmail.com<br><br><strong>Institution or Affiliation</strong><br>Peer 2 Peer University<br><br><strong>URL</strong><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;about">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;about</a><br><br><strong>A 500 word abstract for presentation or session</strong><br>Peer2PeerUniversity (P2PU.org) is a community that provides a social wrapper that gathers learners around open educational materials. It&#x27;s volunteer driven and all P2PU courses are peer-led, offered on the web and available for free.. We&#x27;ve been running courses since 2009. Anyone can propose to lead a course at P2PU. The community collaborates with the new organizer through the design process: from creating a syllabus of openly-licensed resources, to generating social collaboration within the course, to inviting experts to share their wisdom.<br><br>P2PU courses range from the practical (Copyright for Educators, Land Restoration) to the creative (Open Creative Non-fiction), the experimental (DIY Maths) to the cerebral (Inteligencia Coletiva e Ava <em>Portuguese</em>, Queer Theory). There are also&nbsp; curated courses with reputable career tracks such as the School of Webcraft run in partnership with Mozilla.<br><br>P2PU is based on the web but spans the world with participation from communities within South Africa, Brazil, Australia, the USA, Canada, India, Japan, UK, Germany, Spain and beyond. Our community offers courses in English, Spanish and Portuguese and we plan to support more languages in the near future, especially Mandarin Chinese.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this session we will present an overview of P2PU paying particular attention to the course development and community approval process. We believe that as world structures continue to change, education and training will need to become dynamic and responsive enough to reach audiences when and where they need it. Educational systems which rely on approved experts to lead classes after slow-paced institutional approval are neither scalable nor fast enough to respond to deal with changing contexts.<br><br>A peer-to-peer model such as that being developed by P2PU provides the social elements that allow rapid collaboration. We&#x27;d like to explore the community process behind&nbsp; P2PU course collaboration and work with the workshop audience to explore future scenarios which would benefit from a responsive peer led learning model.<br><br>We imagine that scenarios brought for discussion in the workshop might cover transformative learning that drives change (public health) and responsive learning that responds to change (resilient agriculture for changing climates).<br><br>The workshop leaders would also like to explore how to link and transition the peer-run learning process from its current online and globally context&nbsp; to local and real world pods of learning.<br><br><strong>Speaker biography (max. 150 words)</strong><br><br>Alison Jean Cole&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Portland, Oregon<br>Alison helps folks design awesome courses at P2PU. She is also a gardener and is currently working on a hardmade masters degree: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;grungefarmer&#x2e;org&#x2F;handmade&#x2d;masters&#x2e;html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grungefarmer.org&#x2F;handmade-masters.html</a><br>Pippa Buchanan - Australian resident in Berlin, Germany<br>Pippa&nbsp; coordinates the School of Webcraft project for Mozilla and P2PU. She also gardens, builds small boats and is slowly working on her own DIY masters exploring friendship theory and resilience.<br><br><strong>The type of activity (talk, demo, workshop, experience, etc)</strong><br>Workshop (2-3 hours)- Brainstorming future uses of peer-led, free, and open education communities<br><br><strong>Will the talk&#x2F;presentation be presented for the first time at FutureEverything?</strong><br>Yes<br><br><br><br><br>=======================================================================<br><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;futureeverything&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;futureeverything.org&#x2F;</a><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;award&#x2e;futureeverything&#x2e;org&#x2F;conference2011">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;award.futureeverything.org&#x2F;conference2011</a><br><br><strong>Conference &#x2F; Festival Themes</strong><br><br>There are 6 major festival strands. I think our best bet will be to focus on&nbsp; Imagine Everything (i.e. a free, global, connected learning community), Global &amp; Connected or&nbsp;<br>FutureEverybody<br><br><strong>ImagineEverything</strong><br>Our most daring and wide-ranging conference strand, bringing you&nbsp; insights into tomorrow&#8217;s society, digital creativity and free culture.&nbsp; Taking all of our wildest dreams for the future and imagining what would&nbsp; happen if they really came true is at the heart of this strand.<br><strong>FutureMobilities</strong><br>Exploring future scenarios for smart transport, and looking beyond the&nbsp; transport of everything. How can real-time data systems lead to more&nbsp; sustainable transport? How can travel-time become smarter and more&nbsp; user-controlled? Where are we going and, more importantly, how will we&nbsp; be getting there?<br><strong>Global &amp; Connected</strong><br>Remote collaboration, telepresence, networked performance, local&#x2F;global&nbsp; connections, and group-to-group connectivity are a focus again,&nbsp; following the success of the inaugural GloNet event at FutureEverything&nbsp; 2010.<br><strong>OpenEverything&nbsp;</strong><br>The opening up of datasets by public bodies and private companies has&nbsp; huge repercussions both socially and politically. What models are&nbsp; emerging for the fair and creative use of such material and what are the&nbsp; implications of an open society?<br><strong>FutureEverybody</strong><br>The future must be for everybody &#8211; this was the call to arms from the&nbsp; last festival. A conference strand on citizen engagement will explore&nbsp; how we can connect communities and how citizens can be co-producers in&nbsp; decision making, intelligence gathering and building sustainable cities.<br><strong>Handmade</strong><br>Contemporary craft, digital hacking, interactivities and diy culture. A&nbsp; new maker community is emerging, connecting the culture of traditional&nbsp; skills and materials with modern-day digital production, distribution&nbsp; and interaction techniques. FutureEverything invites makers to create&nbsp; objects, installations and performances that explore the&nbsp; cross-fertilisation of new and traditional media and materials.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Selection Process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Conference Programme Open Submission selection is made via the following process.<br><ul class="bullet"><li>All submissions are first reviewed by the FutureEverything programming staff, and a longlist of proposals created.</li><li>The longlist is peer reviewed by the Advisory Council.</li><li>The Conference Committee advises on the make-up of the sessions and speakers.</li></ul>Submissions are assessed against the following criteria:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Excellence</li><li>Originality</li><li>Significance</li><li>Relevance</li><li>Coherence and Rigour</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></body>
