<body>Local language communities<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Currently, most of P2PU is focused around English courses, interface, community etc</li><li>We have a Spanish interface translation, but not sure if there is still a vibrant community in Spanish</li><li>What kind of tech support do language communities need? Tagging of courses by language? Courses in a given language highlighted when that language is chosen as interface?&nbsp;</li><li>How could language communities be organized? Would a school metaphore be appropriate? How can we support vibrant long-lasting language communities?&nbsp;</li><li>Is there room for local (geographically based) P2PU groups? P2PU Norway? What would these do? How would we organize them?&nbsp;</li><li>Currently, translation into Chinese is underway, and I&#x27;ve been talking to people about creating &quot;P2PU Nordic&quot;</li></ul><br><br>Discussion: Should we put effort into making p2pu available in other languages?&nbsp;<br><br>Action: Look into ubuntu types of translation (using a web interface, not having to extract from GitHub etc - especially important to make it easy to maintain translations, and collaborating on translations)&nbsp;<br>Action: Get all the Spanish courses on top when switching to Spanish. Use tags Espanol or add a language label&#x2F;pulldown menu in course settings. Can also feature English courses below, especially for languages which don&#x27;t have as many courses.<br>Action: Move language-selector to top of front page, make people aware that there are other languages available.<br><br>What are priorities for translation into a new language: Wikipedia is a long process. Do we want to have: there is a minimum standard before you can get live.&nbsp;<br>For example: translate the main interface, a few key pages (how to get involved), and at least one course? Set up a mailing list in that language.<br><br>Having a landing page for a language - links to language specific info like contact person, mailing list, ways to get involved? Use Schools framework?<br><br>Challenge: Right now P2PU website is spread out quite wide (help.p2pu.org, qa.p2pu.org, p2pu.org, wiki.p2pu.org, blog.p2pu.org, pad.p2pu.org, Big Blue Button etc) - all have different translation systems. Which ones are &quot;core ones&quot; that should be translated, and which ones are less important?&nbsp;<br><br>Website is changing very rapidly, and it is hard for translators to keep up with that, even the Spanish translation is already &quot;behind&quot;.&nbsp;<br><br>What content needs to be translated, and what are mechanisms for keeping these up to date? How to get involved, about us, licensing info, course handbook...&nbsp;<br><br>Case study:<br>Translating P2PU into Dutch.<br><br>Problem 1: Language button in bottom right corner<br><br>Solutions:<br>Update translation instructions in GitHub (you can easily begin editing the page while you are logged in, and it will automatically fork and create a pull message). Create a short screencast showing how to do this (Stian).&nbsp;<br><br></body>
