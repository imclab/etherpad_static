Who do we invite?How big do we make it?&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>- it&#8217;s gotta be people who are committed, who WANT to be there. with Berlin, the application process forced people to think about why they wanted to go, what they wanted to accomplish, what they&#8217;d bring to the table (Piet)</strong></li></ul><br><strong>Nadeem: We need t think about how we select people. The events can help us better understand how we fit into a broader landscape that is changing around us. (PS: This sounds like a strategy meeting)</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>How do we fund it?</strong><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>- can self funded events be open for all?</strong></li><li><strong>- for the smaller meetings, we could also attach to other conferences that some of us are going to already</strong></li><li><strong>- perhaps p2pu funds less, in which case ppl will self select more? but this might not be fair? (it can prevent people from participating because of money, the people who can afford to come are not always the right ones)</strong></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Spawn smaller events in partnership with other institutions</strong><br><strong>Billy: worth considering having face to face events at universities where stuff is happening already</strong><br><strong>- University of Michigan and Open.Michigan have tried this in a few ways; in fact, we have a Data Dive - </strong><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;a2datadive&#x2e;org&#x2F;"><strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;a2datadive.org&#x2F;</strong></a><br><strong>Michigan experience has ranged - some have been easy and effective</strong><br><strong>Data Dive is coming up, much bigger and needs someone to pull the right people together</strong><br><strong>- We would need a clear &#8220;Ask&#8221; that local groups can focus on. Currently P2PU events are more focused on building new things &#x2F; ideas, rather than spreading models.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>2 different types of events:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>bring together people in the community to reflect, collaborate, share</strong></li><li><strong>meetings anchored around people who are part of the community with local groups</strong></li></ul><br><strong>Could also do more digital events, including longer events that take place online</strong><br><strong>- Really liked Jane&#8217;s course creation sprint (DU)&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>How do we tie community from f2f meetings back into the larger P2PU community?</strong><br><br></body>
