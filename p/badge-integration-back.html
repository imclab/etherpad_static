<body><strong>BADGE INTEGRATION IN&nbsp; LERNANTA (0.1) -- For more background and the old text of this pad &#x2F;&nbsp; future things to add after the pilot, see time slider</strong><br><br><strong><u>Todo list:</u></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Send&nbsp;&nbsp; email to Erin, John, Jessica, Philipp, Arlton, Chloe so they can give&nbsp; feedback before the end of august of the time for which jessica will be&nbsp;&nbsp; doing the last bits of work on PD on P2PU metrics and starting&nbsp;&nbsp; implementing badges integration.</li><li>Mockups and&#x2F;or&nbsp; questions from Jessica to figure out what was not clear from what we will implement for Web Making 101</li></ul><br><strong><u>Vocabulary:</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Badge: what is awarded as recognision for learning or activity on p2pu.org.</li><li>Bagde Challenges: what users have to accomplish or complete to earn a badge.</li><li>Assesment Logic: different customizable logics for how badge challenges can be completed and the associated badges awarded.</li><li>Tasks: where the peer learning takes place inside a study group or course.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Objective:</u></strong><br>Building basic assessment functionality into Lernanta for the School of Webcraft&#x27;s WebMaking 101 course. This includes:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>support creation of badge challenges</li><li>promote&#x2F;display badges, badge challenges, and awarded badges within the P2PU platform</li><li>allow users to send the badges they earn to the Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI).</li><li>track and report metrics</li></ul><br><strong><u>Core Features&#x2F;Functionality:</u></strong><br><br><strong>ROLES</strong><br><br><strong>(1) Bagde Admins (new role on p2pu)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>To&nbsp; allow schools and p2pu to endorse awarded badges (and provide challenge&nbsp; ideas to be used by multiple groups&#x2F;courses), some or all the initial&nbsp; badge challenges will be created by people appointed by the schools or&nbsp; p2pu.</li><li>These people will need the necessary UI to create and manage challenges and the badges associated with them.</li><li>Creating a badge challenge includes selection and customization of the assesment logic and the badge that will be awarded.</li><li>We&nbsp; will allow superusers and school organizers to select badge challenge&nbsp; creators for p2pu or for the schools (note that superusers and school&nbsp; organizers should not be disallowed to do what badge admins do).</li><li>Badge&nbsp; challenges created badge admins of a school will be associated to the&nbsp; school as well as the corresponding badges (in general the badge&nbsp; challenge will display information about who -- p2pu, a school, or a&nbsp; group&#x2F;course -- endorse them).</li><li>In&nbsp; terms of priorities it is more important to allow schools (SoW in&nbsp; particular) to choose their badge admins, since the WebMaking 101 is&nbsp; part of a school. Keep in mind that the rest will come in the future but&nbsp; focus on the minimum functionality.</li></ul><br><strong>(2) Study Groups&#x2F;Course Organizers (existing role)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Depending&nbsp; on the assesment logic behing them, some badge challenges or all of&nbsp; them will require the interaction between users (e.g. user submits some&nbsp; piece of work for review as proof that (s)he deserves the badge, and&nbsp; someone has to review it).</li><li>This interaction can take place inside a study group or course (this is the case of the web making 101 course).</li><li>We&nbsp; need to confirm if the mentors functionality that will be included at&nbsp; the same time will have a role in the assesments logic (todo: ask John)&nbsp; and thus there will be some interaction occuring outside of groups and&nbsp; courses.</li><li>In&nbsp; order to bring badge challenges into the courses, organizers (maybe&nbsp; participant too if it is not a course but a study group) will select&nbsp; badge challenges endorsed by their school or p2pu to be displayed as&nbsp; tasks inside their study groups or courses.</li><li>It&nbsp; is possible that the Web&nbsp; Making 101 course will&nbsp; require a few badges&nbsp; not endorsed by the school, to give&nbsp; a sense of&nbsp; completion to other&nbsp; tasks of their course, or to the actual&nbsp; course. If this happens then&nbsp; there will be badge challenges and badges not created by badge admins&nbsp; and associated to specific groups or courses. (todo: ask John)</li><li>The&nbsp; developer(s) implementing the functionality for integrating badges into&nbsp; lernanta will make the desicion of how much of the necessary logic will&nbsp; be implemented for all tasks&nbsp;&nbsp; and which part only for the badge&nbsp; challenges.</li><li>After&nbsp; asking John we will get a better idea, but from what we know at the&nbsp; moment the first priority here is to allow selecting endorsed badges to&nbsp; be part of the task list of a group or study group.</li></ul><br><strong>(3) Study Group&#x2F;Course Participants (or users that want to get a badge)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will be awarded to them automatically (based on metrics tracked in p2pu).</li><li>Others&nbsp; will require users to submit pieces of work to a badge challenge, and&nbsp; review eachother work. Kind of what happens currently with comments in a&nbsp; task but now with the clear objective of awarding a badge.</li></ul><br><strong>ASSESSMENTS LOGIC</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Stealth assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>This kind of assessment logic will allow us to automatically award badges based on metrics collected inside p2pu</li><li>We&nbsp; have to see how much customization we can put into them (i.e. if we&nbsp; can&#x2F;want rely to a certain degree on superusers, badge admins and group&nbsp; organizers for their customization and&#x2F;creation) but as a first step we&nbsp; can define them at the source code level and let those creating the&nbsp; badge challenge to choose from the list of stealth assesments we&nbsp; provide.</li><li>we&nbsp; will need help selecting names, images and logic for them, but to speed&nbsp; things up or we can implement examples based on the metrics we are&nbsp; collecting and ask for feedback.</li><li>examples&nbsp; of things we could give recognition for with stealth assesments are:&nbsp; visited course pages X numbers of days in a week, posted X numbers of&nbsp; comments, reviewed X numbers of submitions.</li><li>on&nbsp; the first badge pilot we did not add badges that were awarded based on&nbsp; stealth assessment but the software that we customized for the pilot had&nbsp; badges like these to encourage certain behaivours among their users.</li><li>In&nbsp; terms of priorities stealth assesments are first priority and which&nbsp; ones we will support first will depend on the tracking&#x2F;metrics we are&nbsp; implementing for PD on P2PU</li></ul></li><li><strong>Peer assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>This kind of assessment logic will allow users to get recognision from their peers</li><li>In&nbsp; some cases it will allow users to submit their work for review (e.g. to&nbsp; receive recognition when they learned something) and in others users&nbsp; will nominate their peers directly (e.g. to give recognition to their&nbsp; peers for qualities like good team player)</li><li>Both cases have the roles of &quot;candidate for earning a badge&quot;, and &quot;peer evaluating if the candidate should earn the badge&quot;</li><li>The logic behind them will vary depending on:<ul class="bullet"><li>the&nbsp; scale defined for votes and and threadholds of votes and number of&nbsp; peers evaluations to issue the badge (e.g. we can have peers evaluate&nbsp; from a scale from 1 to five and require a 3 or higher rating from 3&nbsp; assessors to issue the badge)</li><li>if a rubric consisting of yes or no questions (checkboxs) is provided to help&#x2F;automate a bit how rating is given.</li><li>if a submition is necessary from the candidate that will earn the badge</li><li>what wll be evidence that will be associated to the awarded badge once the challenge is completed by a user.</li><li>if it has to check that the candidate already have some prerequisit badges.</li></ul></li><li>The&nbsp; first badge pilot showed that up&#x2F;down votes were not appropiate because&nbsp; down votes are unlikelly to occur (thus the idea of rating the submited&nbsp; work) and that we need to make it simple for peers to evaluate each&nbsp; other work (thus the idea of providing rubrics with the badge&nbsp; challenges).</li><li>In terms of priorities this kind of assesment logic goes just after the stealth assesment</li></ul></li><li><strong>Guru assesment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will require us to be more restrictive with repect to who can evaluate a canditate (i.e. trigger a badge award).</li><li>This&nbsp; restriction will take place either by requiring that people evaluating&nbsp; to already have those badges or that they have some role (course&nbsp; organizers, badge admins, maybe mentors).</li><li>In other matters this kind of assesment will work like the peer assessment.</li><li>in&nbsp; the case that we require users to have the badge to rate others the&nbsp; initial seeds will be provided through honorary assessment (see below).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Honorary assesment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>For&nbsp; seeding purposes, we will need a way to issue a badge to someone&nbsp; directly even if they have not completed a challenge (see guru&nbsp; assessment for the reason we need this)</li><li>Badge&nbsp; admins will be able to do this and the evidense will include who&nbsp; awarded them the badge and why (text filled out by the badge admin).</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>BADGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>For&nbsp; badges we need the information that will go into the OBI (name, short&nbsp; description, image) and a little more (long description) to display in&nbsp; the badge page which url will go to the OBI when a badge is awarded.</li></ul><br><strong>BADGE CHALLENGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Creating a badge challenge will include:<ul class="bullet"><li>Filling out a title and description.</li><li>Selecting and configuring the assessment logic.</li><li>Chossing the badge that will be awarded to those completing the challenge.</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>WORK SUBMISSIONS</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will require candidates to submit a piece of work for review.</li><li>Submissions will use rich text (meaning users can embed things like github gists, ... as part of their submition).</li><li>we&nbsp; need versioning (like we have on tasks) for submissions because users&nbsp; can go back to improve their work (don&#x27;t think we need to reset the&nbsp; votes after the user posts a new version if it is clear which votes&nbsp; correspond to each version).</li><li>users&nbsp; should be able to &quot;delete&quot; a work submition (and restore it). data will&nbsp; remain on the database but it will not be displayed. -- the # of&nbsp; deleted submissions and versions can be included as a metric too</li><li>if an assesor votes again in a different version the old vote will be voided in the count but still appear on the evidence</li></ul><br><strong>AWARDED BADGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>It&#x27;s was goes into the OBI.<ul class="bullet"><li>data from the badge (name, short description)</li><li>the badge challenge (url that points to the page with information about the criteria for awarding the badge)</li><li>evidence&nbsp; (url to a page that has the evidence of how the badge was awarded.&nbsp; depending on the badge challenge and the assessment logic this will vary&nbsp; but as and example it could have all the submissions from the user and&nbsp; the ratings + feedback (s)he got)</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>WALL ACTIVITIES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Activity&nbsp; around badges will be on the existing &#x27;Default&#x27;, &#x27;Learning&#x27;, and &#x27;All&#x27;&nbsp; filters of the walls (groups&#x2F;courses, dashboard, profiles)</li><li>A new filter will be included just for activity related to Badges (named &#x27;Badges&#x27;).</li></ul><br><strong>BADGE CHALLENGE ENDORSMENT</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>As&nbsp; we said before challenges will have a default&nbsp; endorsment depending on&nbsp; who created them (someone appointed by a school,&nbsp; p2pu or inside a&nbsp; course).</li><li>If&nbsp; we implement support for badge challenges that created inside study&nbsp; group courses, as next step we should provide to badge admins:<ul class="bullet"><li>a way to endorse those challenges so they are marked as endorsed by the school)</li><li>a way to group&#x2F;course badge challenges to the list of school challenges.</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>METRICS</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>We will have to report metrics to evaluate the use of badges in p2pu (to superusers and school organizers)</li><li>It can include:<ul class="bullet"><li># badges issued.</li><li>for&nbsp; those badge challenges that require candidates to submit a piece of&nbsp; work, # of submissions and number of people that submitted work</li><li>&nbsp;for those badge challenges that requiere people to rate submissions, # evaluations and average rating</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></body>
