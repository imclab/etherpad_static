<body>Possible improvements to osqa implemented customizations (we also have to decide which of the medium priority tasks should be upgraded to high priority tasks, and which improvements should have medium or low priority):<br><br>(Erin&#x27;s comments in this ugly green below)<br><br>1) Relate a vote to its comment and display &#x27;vote up&#x27;, &#x27;vote down&#x27;, &#x27;cancel vote up&#x27;, &#x27;cancel vote down&#x27; before the comment. - HIGH - added it to Pivotal Tracker<br>2) Allow to change to commenting mode after clicking the vote buttons and entering some text. -- this means I was going to vote and started writting my comment but now I only want to submit the comment and not the vote. - This is a good catch. I will have to go back through and see the ux. I know someone can undo a vote by clicking in the other direction, but yeah, then what happens to the comment...<br>3) Change the label of the &#x27;Comment&#x27; button depending on the action.<br>4) Provide some kind of feedback about why answer or voting is disable for some questions. Right now the user can not vote or answer depeding on the badge associated with the question, but he does not know why? Ex. If the badge requires 3 other badges to submit an answer there should be a message saying something like: &#x27;You will need to obtain BadgeA, BadgeB, and BadgeC before being able to submit an answer to this question.&#x27; - Oh, this is important. I think people will be confused. Even if just a link to &quot;Why can&#x27;t I vote&quot; or a pop up when someone tries to click on the vote. Adding to Pivotal Tracker.<br>5) Display more information about the custom Badges in the Badge page: ex. a longer description, the name of the associated tag. - This is good too, it would be great to include the challenge&#x2F;rubric with the badge on the dedicated badge page. If you add this to the Django admin interface (as part of the create a custom badge form), I can add this in. Adding to Pivotal Tracker<br>6) Provide hints about how to create a question for a given badge. - LOW since I will be creating all the badge questions this time around.<br>7) I think that this is a medium or low task but another improvement will be to customize the texts displayed in different pages of osqa using terms from the badges&#x2F;assestment vocabulary.<br>6) Import more info about the drupal users (if the email is validated in drupal [correction drupal does not follow the register-receive-email-confirm-email workflow], maybe deside that some roles in drupal correspond to roles in osqa, maybe import some data about the openids they have configured in drupal).<br>7) Decide if we should allways authenticate againts the password stored in drupal or if we are going to save it to our database the first time he logs in, and use that one from there on.<br>8) Decide if we are going to allow registering directly in osqa (if users can register some of them will not use their drupal identities). - I think everyone should have a P2PU account since they are in courses.&nbsp; Can we add text to the create account page which says, log in with your P2PU id below. Maybe even hide the other create account options?<br>9) ...<br><br></body>
