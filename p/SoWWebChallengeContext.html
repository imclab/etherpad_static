You&#x27;ll use your html pages to provide the structure for a CMS Template eg. Wordpress. You&#x27;ll reuse and refine your CSS files to update the styles of your site.<br><br><strong>Learning Context</strong><br>The School of Webcraft is a free, online web development community hosted within P2PU.org, a general peer learning community. Learners self-organise study groups and courses.&nbsp; Learners discuss their work together using an asynchronous forum style interface and some also take the initiative to organise synchronous chat and meetings using tools such as IRC, Tokbox and etherpad.<br><br>School of Webcraft along with P2PU and Mozilla is exploring the Open Badges Framework, which will allow learners to earn badges which can be linked to online portfolios.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Design Motivation</strong><br>High quality, engaging and easily understandable learning&nbsp; materials have been difficult to find for the purposes of this project as free and ideally openly licensed materials are required. Where up-to-date accessible materials exist they are written with a formal, academic audience in mind and haven&#x27;t been popular with learners.&nbsp;<br><br>The Web Challenge project requires engaging and clear tasks which reflect the best of open and standards based development practice.&nbsp; The learning content should encourage social engagement, peer support and discussion with other learners, but the materials should be useful and engaging for learners working independently of a group.<br><br>The Web Challenge content should provide the necessary information and exercises to prepare learners for earning relevant badges.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>==== The Learners ====</strong><br><br><strong>General Demographics</strong><br>School of Webcraft learners range in age from their late teens to their mid 60s. Predominantly male but there are many women present within the community. For the first iteration of the Webmaking 101 challenges it is safe to presume that most learners will be confident at speaking English and come from the US and UK. However, the audience is global and there is a strong South American (Spanish and Portuguese) and sub-continent audience who will participate using English as a second language.<br><br><strong>Learner Motivation</strong><br>While many of the project&#x27;s audience are wanting to work as&nbsp; professional web developers, a large part of the learners wish to incorporate web dev skills in their existing profession (eg. teachers, writers, designers).&nbsp; At the earlier stages of web dev learning, eg. Webmaking 101 the audience is more general, reflecting both the professional and supplemental skill motivations. Webmaking 101 can be expected to attract more women and older learners than advanced topics in School of Webcraft. Maintaining a more equal audience beyond Webmaking 101 and into advanced technical topics would be a positive outcome.<br><br><strong>Learner Technical Background</strong><br>For a subject such as Webmaking 101 it is important to note that the technical confidence and skills of learners will vary and may be very limited. While it is safe to presume that most learners will have confidence with the web and social media such as Facebook, many people at this early stage will lack experience in general technical skills such as installing software and understanding file types. Webcraft learners predominantly use Microsoft based operating systems, with some Mac OSX and Linux used as well.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Open and free culture background&nbsp;</strong><br>Some users may be aware of Creative Commons, FLOSS and the concept of open standards and free culture, however this shouldn&#x27;t be assumed. In general P2PU attracts many learners aware of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;free&quot; and interested in learning in new ways, but the technical domain of School of Webcraft attracts people interested in learning web development <em>specifically</em>. This reduces learner&#x27;s understanding of how P2PU &quot;works&quot; and it will be sensible to explain how peer-learning and open licensing will operate within the Webmaking 101 context.<br><br><strong>Learning Styles</strong><br>A large scale analysis of the learning styles of P2PU and more specifically SoW learners has not been made. However, given that there is much criticism of learning styles (Coffield, 2005) and the proposed audience is open and difficult to survey, it may be better to try and support multiple learning styles in Webmaking 101. In this respect the more traditional approach of Kolb or Honey and Mumford&#x27;s could be considered, as Kolb&#x27;s cycle flow of learning would support multiple learning styles. (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;businessballs&#x2e;com&#x2F;kolblearningstyles&#x2e;htm&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessballs.com&#x2F;kolblearningstyles.htm)</a><br><br><strong>Publication Method</strong><br>In its initial iteration, learning content will be distributed as a series of &quot;tasks&quot; within the School of Webcraft subsite of P2PU.org. These tasks support embedded images and video as well as text. Preformatted text can be used to present code samples.<br><br><strong>Localisation</strong><br>The Web Challenge will be published under an open license which will allow for reuse, remixing and free distribution. There is an international, multi-lingual audience for School of Webcraft materials and all materials produced should be suitable for localisation.&nbsp; Text, audio and video can all be localised relatively easily, however, text within images will be a challenge. Where possible, open format image files (eg. readable by commercial products and freesoftware such as GIMP or Inkscape) should be archived to allow text localisations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Maintaining Releases</strong><br>The nature of web development requires that for materials to have a long life-time, they need to be updated to reflect contemporary technologies. While the initial version of these texts should be released as soon as possible as tasks within P2PU, a longer term distribution system should be considered.&nbsp;<br><br>Until now, openly licensed courseware has not taken advantage of version control systems as a way of monitoring suggested changes, merging improvements and finalising an updated release. It is proposed that software development tools such as GIT be considered as a way of maintaining Web Challenge content for the longer term.&nbsp;<br><br>The use of an version control tool will make it easier for quality to be maintained and will still allow improvements to be suggested. Understandably the localisation of text documents, subtitle files etc requires a different approach to the use of&nbsp; language files.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>How to publish and release versions of the Web Challenges?</strong><br><br><br>A CC license or similar gives freedom but makes it harder to import changes. A wiki is great but is ever changing. Something like GIT will let versions be released but allow for new changes to be pushed back in. I&#x27;d personally recommend hosting the original content in GIT. but how does a git server easily synch with the Lernanta software and feed back into tasks?<br><br><br>Note: these challenges are something that should be considered in a broader OER context<br>Sharing is good, but collaborative improvements are better, introducing the concept of a module owner &#x2F; release process may further improve the quality fo content that is released.&nbsp; How does this feed into delivering updated content to other services eg Connexions for the Dept of Labour project?&nbsp;<br>Continually changing Wiki content is not going goto be suitable in this context, but moderated suggestions updated to&nbsp; a regular release may be more suitable. IF we can think about how to solve this problem with this immediate Web Challenge project it will be of long term benefit outside of SoW too.<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Audience:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>English language audience</li><li>Inconsistency of background knowledge - we need a way of bringing all users up to speed - a pre-flight checklist so to say.</li></ul><br><br><strong>Primary audience:&nbsp;</strong><br>People wanting to become Web Developers.&nbsp;<br><strong>Secondary audience</strong>:&nbsp;<br>Users may also be hobbyists, teachers, scientists etc who want web dev basics as part of a broader skillset.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Social &#x2F; Connections</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Are meetings between learners part of the proposed solution.</li><li>Will there be facilitators (experienced or otherwise)</li><li>Is connecting local groups together part of the goals?</li></ul><br><br><strong>PreFlight Checklist</strong><br><br><br>Can this pre-flight checklist be framed within a task &#x2F; series of tasks &#x2F; lessons itself?<br><br><br>How the web works - client &#x2F; server<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;flickr&#x2e;com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;johndbritton&#x2F;sets&#x2F;72157624932677905&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;johndbritton&#x2F;sets&#x2F;72157624932677905&#x2F;</a><br><br><br><br>eg. you need an Internet connection - you&#x27;re reading this on the web - PASS<br>You need a web browser to interpret - get the latest version? - Share the version number and browser you&#x27;re using<br>Why browser upgrades matter (web standards) or is this too early in the learning process?<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * An internet connection<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * A web browser to develop with + others to test on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Webhosting - note this introduces complexities in itself&nbsp; - see discussion below-&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * webhosting - what are the minimum requirements. it&#x27;s all very well to say just get basic space able&nbsp; to host PHP and HTML etc, but after webmaking hopefully developers are going to attempt using other frameworks that may require different settings<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * An imageeditor - recommending GIMP is all fine, but you still need to explain to users how to edit with GIMP&nbsp; = what resource do you send them to?
