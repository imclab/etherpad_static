<body>Hey Webmaking 101 Beta Tester,<br><br>Thanks for participating in the School of Webcraft Webmaking 101 Beta Challenges. To formally thank you, we have issued you a Beta Hero badge that you can use to demonstrate your webmaking superpowers. pow pow pow.<br><br>Moving forward, we are planning on making these Challenges even better by improving the badges associated with them.

One focused on learning, and one focused on fun. You will get overall feedback on difficulty level from your next question. Also difficulty level depends a lot on the respondent - for an advanced user the challenges would be too easy, for a beginner they may be too hard. Without knowing who we deal with it&#x27;s difficult to use the data.</li><li>Make sure each answer option only represents one statement. For example, the first one -&gt; someone could love it because they learned a lot, but they didn&#x27;t think it was fun. Or they thought it was fun and loved it, but didn&#x27;t learn anything. When you mix statements you get muddled results.</li><li>There is one more thing here that I can&#x27;t find a good solution to. Say that someone came to the challenges, but they are already a more advanced developer. They are likely to not enjoy the experience and not learn a lot (and they might not want more advanced challenges, because they haven&#x27;t been able to test the system). Might have to add a filter question to make sure the respondent feels these challenges were designed for them. Maybe, but not 100% convinced yet:<ul class="bullet"><li>Were the challenges designed for someone at your skill level?&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Too easy</li><li>Just right</li><li>Too hard</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Please give us your overall impression of the challenges?<s>Overall how would you rate your learning experience taking the Webmaking 101 Challenges?</s></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>I loved them!&nbsp;</li><li>They were good, but there is room for improvement.&nbsp;</li><li>They were ok.

Choose a few terms and repeat them (don&#x27;t vary terms - which would be good practice in writing generally)</li><li>Simplify the survey as much as possible. Once you start asking complex questions, the analysis becomes more work and is often meaningless because of a small sample size.</li></ul><br></body>
