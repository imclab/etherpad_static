<body><strong>Stage 1</strong><br><strong>Due 11&#x2F;14&#x2F;2011</strong><br>More info: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;dmlcompetition&#x2e;net&#x2F;Competition&#x2F;4&#x2F;badges&#x2d;stage&#x2d;1&#x2e;php">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dmlcompetition.net&#x2F;Competition&#x2F;4&#x2F;badges-stage-1.php</a>&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Proposal</strong><br><br>My answers inline (in <em>italics</em>) with the questions. Obvious draft but there to get thoughts out and see how well we align to the purpose of the competition.<br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>The learning content, programs, or activities that will be supported by badges</strong>. What are the primary domains of learning reflected by the content, programs, or activities? What are the overall goals for learning? Who is the main learning audience or target community? Does learning occur at a specific place or time (i.e., where and when)? How does learning typically occur? What programs and activities will a learner or group of learners experience?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>There is an expressed need within the open community (encompassing Open Education, Open Access Publishing, Free&#x2F;Open Source Software) to be familiar with copyright and licensing issues that community members face on an ongoing basis.</em></li><li><em>The content is used in both asynchronous and synchronous ways: individual study with group discussions.</em></li><li><em>...</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>The skills, competencies and achievements badges will validate.</strong> These may include traditional skills like writing or sports, programming in a particular language, operating a specific type of machinery, or 21st Century skills such as collaboration, communication, and teamwork. One of the benefits of badges over more traditional assessments is their ability to represent a wider range of accomplishments and evidence about an individual&#8217;s capacities, and provide a more complete and nuanced picture of their accomplishments and attributes. What are the main skills represented or developed within this content or learning experience? Are these skills and competencies better understood as discrete levels, or measurements of continuing performance?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>The individual badges associated with this work are best thought of as discrete parts that can be used together to build something larger (eg: how to start your own open source start up).</em></li><li><em>The pieces thus far:</em><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Basic copyright knowledge</em><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Australia: </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;copyright&#x2d;4&#x2d;educators&#x2d;aus&#x2F;content&#x2F;syllabus&#x2d;for&#x2d;copyright&#x2d;4&#x2d;educators&#x2d;aus&#x2F;"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;copyright-4-educators-aus&#x2F;content&#x2F;syllabus-for-copyright-4-educators-aus&#x2F;</em></a></li><li><em>USA: </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;general&#x2F;copyright&#x2d;4&#x2d;educators&#x2d;us"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.p2pu.org&#x2F;general&#x2F;copyright-4-educators-us</em></a></li></ul></li><li><em>Creative Commons licenses basics</em><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Version 1: </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;general&#x2F;creative&#x2d;commons&#x2d;4&#x2d;educators"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.p2pu.org&#x2F;general&#x2F;creative-commons-4-educators</em></a></li><li><em>Version 2: </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;creative&#x2d;commons&#x2d;4&#x2d;educators&#x2F;content&#x2F;full&#x2d;description&#x2F;"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;creative-commons-4-educators&#x2F;content&#x2F;full-description&#x2F;</em></a></li></ul></li><li><em>Free&#x2F;Open Source licenses basics (yet to be created)</em></li><li><em>Copyright &amp; Open Access publishing basics (yet to be created)</em></li><li><em>Open Project Funding - </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;general&#x2F;getting&#x2d;your&#x2d;cc&#x2d;project&#x2d;funded"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.p2pu.org&#x2F;general&#x2F;getting-your-cc-project-funded</em></a></li><li><em>Open Governance - </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;general&#x2F;node&#x2F;5618&#x2F;document&#x2F;5619"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.p2pu.org&#x2F;general&#x2F;node&#x2F;5618&#x2F;document&#x2F;5619</em></a></li><li><em>... others I forgot?</em></li></ul></li><li><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Identity and roles.</strong> Do the proposed learning content, programs, or activities support specific identities or roles for the learner? For example, will they assume the role of a scientist, sound engineer, or writer, or build the identity of a collaborator, leader or creator?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>This proposal will, by design, be useful for everyone who has a common interest in producing openly shared resources no matter their context.</em></li><li><em>....</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Opportunities or Privileges.</strong> A badge or set of badges can be designed to provide opportunities or confer privileges to learners. What opportunities or privileges can arise from the content, programs, or activities? For example, advancing through a set of badges may provide access to mentorship or internships, available equipment, review of work by professionals, access to an elite community, or a new experience.<ul class="bullet"><li><em>As these badges will be provided by Creative Commons, there is a certain level of respect that is inferred onto the badge recipient. This will enable potential employers dealing with the open community to better trust the capabilities that this person has. Specifically, effectively communicating to a community the issues that a project is facing as their related to sharing.</em></li><li><em>....</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Existing assessments.</strong> What existing assessments or tools, if any, do you have for tracking or measuring performance? Do they align well with badges? How so?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>The Peer2Peer University (P2PU) has a platform which was designed to track the progress of individuals. Badges fit nicely within the system as a means of rewarding completion.</em></li><li><em>....</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Partners and Organizations.</strong> Does the proposed badge or set of badges require partners and&#x2F;or other organizations? What are their roles in the learning content, programs, or activities, and potential roles in creating a badge or set of badges? Does your team, or a partner organization, include someone with expertise in assessment?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>We would work closely with P2PU as a collaborator on this project. As a part of our team we will have individuals with experience teaching courses on P2PU and close connections with the educational community.</em></li><li><em>....</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Administration of the badges.</strong> Who would administer the badges -- your organization or a partner? Where would the badges be deployed or displayed? Would they appear on your website or another website? How would this occur and what infrastructure will be required to support it?<ul class="bullet"><li><em>Both P2PU and Creative Commons would administer the badges with P2PU taking lead on the technical infrastructure (hosting, deploying) with Creative Commons taking the lead of creating and administering the assessment protocols.</em></li><li><em>.... (more about the tech stuff from P2PU)</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Branding.</strong> Ultimately, a badge or set of badges for your community of interest will represent you beyond your institution. What elements of your brand are relevant to your badges? These may be general brand perception elements or specific visual elements like logos, colors, shapes, etc. Consider that you may begin with a single badge but that it may grow into a family of badges and ultimately a full ecosystem.<ul class="bullet"><li><em>The Creative Commons brand is a strong and recognizable brand in many of its forms (eg: the letters &quot;CC&quot;, the logo, the license buttons). Thus, we will incorporate the appropriate elements of the CC brand into the cc-related&#x2F;administered badges. The other badges will incorporate the P2PU brand as appropriate.</em></li></ul></li></ul><br></body>
