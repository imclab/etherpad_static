<body>Nadeem is interested in Cyberpunk literature. It&#x27;s a topic that isn&#x27;t really covered widely by universities and certainly not offered anywhere online for free. He lives a digital life. He works online, hangs out online and likes to read and learn things online. He&#x27;s comfortable being a digital citizen, and is more interested in learning something by himself in his own time than going to an offline institution to go through a degree or course as a way of learning more about cyberpunk literature, and if he makes some friends along the way, then that&#x27;s an added bonus.&nbsp;<br><br>(<em>traditional&#x2F; this use of the terms came naturally to us)</em><br>He finds out about P2PU and <strong>signs-up</strong> to the site, where he finds a cyberpunk <strong>course</strong>. He decides to <strong>join</strong> the course and <strong>signs</strong>-<strong>up</strong> for its next iteration.The course is open, and has only been half-created by the organiser. She&#x27;s a bit lazy, and has asked people to share their ideas and suggestions for materials and readings. All the <strong>users</strong> who <strong>signed up</strong> to <strong>take</strong> the <strong>course</strong> were able to edit it and they made many changes. All the <strong>participants</strong> are making suggestions to the <strong>course outline</strong>, and are helping her to <strong>collect </strong>and organise the <strong>materials</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><em>(we tried to stretch to the innovative&#x2F; but it feels and sounds weird)</em><br>As part of the course, there is a <strong>challenge </strong>that has been set, where <strong>participants</strong> are asked to work with a <strong>peer</strong> to write and illustrate a story. He decides to <strong>tackle it</strong> and <strong>starts</strong> the <strong>challenge</strong>. Nadeem and his <strong>fellow particpants &#x2F; peers</strong> have such fun doing this, they they decide to look for partners from the cyberpunk literature world, and <strong>start</strong> a <strong>school</strong> of modern fiction, where published authors <strong>mentor</strong> and <strong>teach</strong> P2PU participants. As these <strong>mentees</strong> finish a <strong>set</strong> of courses and challenges, they <strong>earn</strong> <strong>badges</strong>, which they can collect together and use across platforms to show people what they have created.&nbsp;<br><br></body>
