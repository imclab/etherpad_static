<body><strong><u>Challenge 1</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;webcraft&#x2d;rahim&#x2e;posterous&#x2e;com&#x2F;71381240">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcraft-rahim.posterous.com&#x2F;71381240</a></li><li>Like the others said, maybe change it to something like &quot;Create a blog and write three sentences about yourself.&quot; This will remove some of the mental friction involved with writing a blog post about one&#x27;s self (which is typically difficult for most people), and will make it easier for people to read and comment other people&#x27;s blogs. With only three sentences, it leaves the comments open for questions rather than comments, which will create conversations on the person&#x27;s blogs. (&quot;Wow, you went to New York, I&#x27;m going there next week. Where do you recommend I eat?&quot; rather than &quot;Cool story, bro.&quot;</li><li>I don&#x27;t know about the others, but I felt some trepidation with creating a blog. I know companies like Tumblr and Posterous have made it easy, but in my mind I&#x27;m still thinking &quot;ugh, this is going to be a pain.&quot; It&#x27;d be cool if there were one created for me already by P2PU that I could just &quot;claim&quot; and get going on. I know that&#x27;s basically the same thing as Tumblr, but it seems easier in my mind.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Challenge 2</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;webcraft&#x2d;rahim&#x2e;posterous&#x2e;com&#x2F;71383582">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcraft-rahim.posterous.com&#x2F;71383582</a></li><li>I like this challenge. I think it serves an important purpose.</li><li>I also like the Karate Kid reference, it helps people get into the mindset that this is a small something leading towards a greater whole.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Challenge 3</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>I&#x27;d ditch the free as in beer or speech part. I think it&#x27;ll end up confusing more people than it helps.</li><li>Overall, I&#x27;m not a fan of this challenge. I think you&#x27;re better off recommending a text editor for each platform, and listing a few alternatives. For me, I started with any text editor (I think it may have been Notepad), and then when it failed to meet a need, I went looking for another one. It&#x27;s hard to evaluate a bunch of text editors when you&#x27;re starting out if you don&#x27;t know what it is you&#x27;re looking for.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Challenge 4</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>I didn&#x27;t do this challenge, but like the creativity behind it.</li><li>If I were a student doing the challenges, this is the one I would cheat on by using Google Image search instead of walking around taking photos.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Challenge 5</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>I&#x27;d ditch the entire domain hacking section. I think it complicates matters more than it needs to.</li><li>This challenge feels really overwhelming and complicated. I think it might be good to break this up into smaller challenges with some extra hand-holding.</li></ul><br></body>
