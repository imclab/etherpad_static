<body>= Activity about finding open content =<br><br><strong>Teach someone something with open content -- </strong><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;teach&#x2d;someone&#x2d;something&#x2d;with&#x2d;open&#x2d;content&#x2F;"><strong>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;teach-someone-something-with-open-content&#x2F;</strong></a><br>Learn how to find and recognize open content on the web.<br><br>This challenge will help you learn how to find and recognize open content, such as public domain and Creative Commons licensed video, images, and websites, in the wild. You&#x27;ll get acquainted with good collections of open content and ways to find them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Task 1: Choose your topic or question</strong><br>Choose your topic or question. If you are known as the go-to person among your friends or family for help with a particular topic area, that might be a good one to choose because once you&#x27;ve compiled some good open resources, it will be easy to share them next time someone comes to you with questions. You could also select a topic you are interested in learning more about, or one on which you consider yourself an expert, even if no one else does.&nbsp;<br><br>Discuss whether or not there might be open content that answers your question. Have you looked for resources on this subject before? If so, what kind of resources you have found?&nbsp;<br><br>Hint: This page will help you spot licensed work out in the world: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;Recognizing&#x5f;licensed&#x5f;work">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;Recognizing_licensed_work</a>.<br><br><strong>Task 2: Go find your resources</strong><br>Go find your resources. Gather as many or as few as you need to fully address your question. Make a note of where you find them, and how they can be shared and used (based on the license or copyright status).&nbsp;<br><br>You have three choices for how to conduct your search. You can look in collections and repositories of open content, such as Flickr or OER Commons, or you can search the open web, perhaps using advanced search features to limit your results to websites with open licenses.&nbsp;<br><br>Some good places to find open content are...<br>Flickr&nbsp;<br>Wikipedia<br>Vimeo<br>OER Commons<br><br>Or, if you want to try exploring a wider range of resources, watch this screencast on how to use Google to search for open content across the whole web.<br><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;video&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;videoplay&#x3f;docid&#x3d;1406723177945793034">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.google.com&#x2F;videoplay?docid=1406723177945793034</a><br><br>You can also ask your friends, colleagues, and the rest of the world! Tap into existing communities that share information or resources about the topic you are interested in and ask them. Some communications tools communities use include mailing lists (Google groups, ibiblio), social media (Twitter, Facebook), and discussion forums on the web. Pose your question with the appropriate tags, and don&#x27;t hesitate to ask the same questions on your personal, social network.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Task 3: Post links to the results of your search</strong><br>Share what you&#x27;ve found so far. Were you able to find what you needed? How might you use the stuff that you found? Were there good repositories or sources of content that were particularly valuable? How about any that were hard to use? Was it easy to tell whether or not things were open, and what the license was? Could you tell what the origins of the work were?&nbsp;<br><br><br>= Activity for using and sharing open content =<br><br><strong>Teach someone something with open content, part 2 -- </strong><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;teach&#x2d;someone&#x2d;something&#x2d;with&#x2d;open&#x2d;content&#x2d;part&#x2d;2&#x2F;"><strong>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;teach-someone-something-with-open-content-part-2&#x2F;</strong></a><br>Learn how to assemble and adapt open content from the web.<br><br>This challenge will focus on pulling open content together from the web (based on the finding challenge) and figuring out how to properly attribute and mark what you&#x27;re using.<br><br><strong>Task 1: Assemble your resources.</strong><br>You know what you want to teach and found resources on the web to help you. Now you have to assemble these resources.<br><br>First, make sure you know where you found all your content. Make note of things like the website URL and the creator. Also, what open license did it have? When was it created and&#x2F;or pubilshed? These are important pieces to keep track of so that others can get back to the source information.&nbsp;<br><br>Remember that with CC licenses, you don&#x27;t need to ask the original creators for permission to use their work as long as you follow the terms and conditions of the license. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t thank them or let them know you&#x27;re using it! Shout-outs on Twitter or in the comments section of a blog or Flickr image are nice practices.&nbsp;<br><br>You may discover that you don&#x27;t have the rights to use every resource you found. Which resources do not give you the rights you want? You might want to do another search to find appropriately licensed materials to replace those. Remember, each open license carries with it different conditions, eg. if you intend to make a profit with the final product, you would need to find content without the &quot;noncommercial&quot; or NC license clause.<br><br>Lastly, consider the places where you found your resources. Did you like anything about some of the websites and&#x2F;or platforms where the resources were hosted? For example, did the platform make it easier for you to identify the CC or other open license of the resource? You may want to keep a list of the sites you liked for sharing back your resulting work.<br><br><strong>Task 2: Edit and change the resources as needed.</strong><br>What changes do you want to make to the existing resources? Do you have the rights to make changes according to the open license on the work?<br><ul class="indent"><li><br></li></ul>You grabbed a picture from Flickr and you want to crop it to remove that blurry finger in the upper left corner. Great, but does the license allow for that edit? Some CC licenses have a &quot;no derivatives&quot; or ND clause. That means you can only use that resource exactly how it&#x27;s been shared with you. That means no cropping the image, fixing the grammatical errors in a paragraph, or even brightening a picture. This might be new to you, but that&#x27;s the nature of the license. (In some regions of the world, you can still rely on fair use or fair dealing, aka exceptions and limitations to copyright - learn more about that in this other challenge (TBD).) Using works without the ND clause allows for derivatives, so those are your best bet if you want to be able to edit the resource you&#x27;re using. But remember that if you&#x27;re making a derivative of someone else&#x27;s work and they want you to &quot;share-alike&quot; (the SA clause), you will have to license your derivative work with the same license as the original.&nbsp;<br><br>Keep in mind that you can often make these changes and edits to the resource directly, depending on where the resources is hosted. For example, YouTube&#x27;s Video Editor allows for you to remix CC BY-licensed videos on its platform, and Wikipedia allows universal edits. You can also choose to upload a duplicate instance of the resource to an editing platform and make edits to that. Choose the platform that you are most comfortable with and that allows open licensing.<br><br><strong>Task 3: Attribute the original authors.</strong><br>You&#x27;ve assembled and adapted your resources in the way you want to teach them. Now it&#x27;s time to provide proper attribution to the original authors.&nbsp;<br><br>Building on the work of others is awesome. And recognizing those you&#x27;re building on is a great practice for encouraging sharing of more resources. &quot;Citation&quot; and &quot;Attribution&quot; are often used as synonyms, but they mean two different things. Citation is a scholarly practice for tracking the ideological underpinnings of a work, usually referencing sources like published books, articles, government documents, primary sources, etc. Citation is a norm, not a legal requirement. Attribution is about crediting a copyright holder according to the terms of a copyright license, usually crediting artistic works like music, fiction, video, and photography. Attribution is a legal condition of using a licensed work.&nbsp;<br><br>See <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;FAQ&#x23;How&#x5f;do&#x5f;I&#x5f;properly&#x5f;attribute&#x5f;a&#x5f;work&#x5f;offered&#x5f;under&#x5f;a&#x5f;Creative&#x5f;Commons&#x5f;license&#x2e;3F">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;FAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_work_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F</a> and the CC wiki <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;Marking&#x2F;Users">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;Marking&#x2F;Users</a> for best practices on providing attribution. Note that if you edited or changed a resource, you need to make note of that in your attribution.<br><br>What challenges did you run into while providing attributions? Do you think the CC wiki best practices for attribution can be improved?

Who do you want to teach and&#x2F;or learn about your topic with? Once you have narrowed it down to one or a few key audiences, think about the websites they frequent the most. For example, if you are sending your little cousin a collection of the best videos on learning Algebra, you might create a playlist on YouTube for him or her to easily watch in one sitting. Perhaps you simply want to put it on your personal website so you can share a link to it with friends and colleagues. If sharing on your own website, remember to follow best practices for marking from Task 3 (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;Marking&#x2F;Users&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;Marking&#x2F;Users)</a>.<br><br>The CC wiki <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;Publish">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;Publish</a> lists communities that allow you to host content for free under CC licenses. These communities may also find your work useful and&#x2F;or help to improve your work. Consider also sharing your work via social media and other tools, such as mailing lists.&nbsp;<br><br>Communities love stories, especially those behind a well assembled resource. Consider documenting the reasoning behind creating the resource you did (eg. to help my little cousin get an A in Algebra!).<br><br>Wherever you decide to share your work, post links here. How did you decide to share it the way you did? What other options did you consider, and why did you rule them out?

Ask yourself, are you creating a collection or a derivative work?&nbsp;&nbsp; eg. are you compiling a bunch of resources together or making changes&nbsp; to&nbsp; the resources? If you&#x27;re making a collection, license compatibility&nbsp;&nbsp; isn&#x27;t mega-critical, as long as you provide proper attribution, in&nbsp; which&nbsp; case you can skip to Task 3.<br>MAYBE EXCLUDE: Here&#x27;s how you might decide&nbsp;&nbsp; between the two: Do you plan on sharing this collection of resources&nbsp;&nbsp; with people other than your&nbsp; friend? What if this is a blog post you&#x27;re&nbsp;&nbsp; making? Does that change&nbsp; anything about the compatibility? Are you&nbsp;&nbsp; licensing your blog? So much&nbsp; to think about! The short of it: the more&nbsp;&nbsp; open the license you use is,&nbsp; the more compatible it will be with&nbsp; other&nbsp; licenses.&nbsp;<br>If you are making a derivative work, see <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;FAQ&#x23;If&#x5f;I&#x5f;derive&#x5f;or&#x5f;adapt&#x5f;a&#x5f;work&#x5f;offered&#x5f;under&#x5f;a&#x5f;Creative&#x5f;Commons&#x5f;license&#x2e;2C&#x5f;which&#x5f;CC&#x5f;license&#x2e;28s&#x2e;29&#x5f;can&#x5f;I&#x5f;apply&#x5f;to&#x5f;the&#x5f;resulting&#x5f;work&#x2e;3F">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;FAQ#If_I_derive_or_adapt_a_work_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.2C_which_CC_license.28s.29_can_I_apply_to_the_resulting_work.3F</a>.
