<body>Subject: Thoughts on Design<br><br>Hey All,<br><br>We&#x27;ve come a long way with respect to design, just give <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.p2pu.org</a> a look and see for yourself. That said, there&#x27;s still quite a lot that we can do to improve. We&#x27;ve been pushing out functional changes quite regularly, but the improvements lack an overarching design strategy and in some cases are inconsistent. I&#x27;d like to introduce my thoughts on design for P2PU and get you involved in making some general decisions that will be used as a guide across the site.&nbsp;<br><br>First I&#x27;d like to make a distinction between design and functionality. When we talk about design, we&#x27;re limiting ourselves to the aesthetic. This includes things like: color, style, shape, composition, and the like. We&#x27;re specifically not talking about content or behaviors.<br><br>I&#x27;ve outlined three major aspects (colors, visuals, and interfaces) of our design and suggested a direction in each with supporting reasoning and how that reasoning informed the attached example. This work also includes a lot of the feedback from previous designs. Please take a look and let me know what you think.<br><br>Quoting Vanessa: &quot;As their feedback process, the Lifelong Kindergarden Lab passes out red, yellow and green post it notes to solicit what&#x27;s not working, what&#x27;s confusing&#x2F;you have questions about, and what&#x27;s awesome.&quot;<br><br>Green: List the awesome stuff<br>Yellow: List the things you are unsure about and want to discuss &#x2F; clarify<br>Red: List the things that don&#x27;t work and _why_ they don&#x27;t work<br><br>IMPORTANT: Please take the time to think about the reasoning behind your opinions and share supporting logic. I&#x27;d like to keep personal opinion out of this as much as possible and would prefer discussing problems and reasoning as opposed to suggested changes without supporting arguments.<br><br>EXAMPLE:<br>* PDF with full comments - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb&#x2e;io&#x2F;zlBNZm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb.io&#x2F;zlBNZm</a><br><br>* JPG Plain - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb&#x2e;io&#x2F;wlE1kT">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb.io&#x2F;wlE1kT</a><br>* JPG Notes - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb&#x2e;io&#x2F;xBfoM7">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdb.io&#x2F;xBfoM7</a><br><br>Comments from the PDF in text form<br><br># Colors - Some reasoning behind color choices<br><br>A. Design Feature: Importance (Non-white background)<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ability to use white background to call attention to important content<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Supports blending with elements in the foreground<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * light blue - normal importance level<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * white - subtly calls attention to content as more important<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * bg-blended gray - strong contrast, indicates actions (ui) the user can take<br><br>B. Design Feature: Color Accents<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Distinguishes different types of content<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Emphasizes related content<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * default accent - orange<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * user&#x2F;account - yellow<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * posting&#x2F;creating&#x2F;making - green<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * search&#x2F;discovery - blue<br><br># Visuals - Setting the style for visual elements<br><br>C. Design Feature: Visuals are Related to the Logo<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Logo is the foundation of our identity<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Uses the four colors in the logo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Uses solid fill, no gradients or patterns, like the logo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Uses a line-drawing style that relates to the outlined style of the logo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Isometric which relates to the sharpness and angular style of the logo - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Isometric&#x5f;projection">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Isometric_projection</a><br><br>D. Design Feature: Visuals are Stylized &amp; Repeatable<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Easy to draw &#x2F; low cost<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Establishes consistency across the site<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fewer decisions to make in the future<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We set the pattern for other visuals: four colors, solid fill, line style, isometric<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * It wasn&#x27;t complicated to make, so the cost for creating matching elements will be low<br><br># Interfaces - Styling user interfaces<br><br>E. Design Feature: Simple Interface Elements<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Don&#x27;t distract people with unnecessary flair<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Stylized elements are more likely to go out of style, minimal &#x2F; basic should stand the test of time<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Easy to implement cross browser<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Interface elements have solid backgrounds with text<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * normal, hover, and active states all follow the style<br><br>F. Design Feature: Interface Shows State&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; * Reasoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Orient the user (Where am I?)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Awareness of interactivity (What can I do?)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Interactive feedback (Can I click this?)<br>&nbsp; * In this example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Primary Navigation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Normal - bg-blended gray with white text<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Hover - white with blended gray text<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Active - white with accent text<br><br></body>
