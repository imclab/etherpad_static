<body><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Starting a conversation between University of Michigan and P2PU to conduct research through the DML competition around the P2PU badge system currently under development.

(VMG is checking with Sunny)<br>Decide on a research question (but we have some leanings)<br><strong>Piet to write up how he thinks this research could benefit U-M (Coursera group, Med School)</strong><br><ul class="indent"><li>As certification of learning becomes more distributed and less focused on academic centers, major academic institutions are doing some soul-searching to understand and articulate the value they bring to society and individuals in the short and long term. The University of Michigan has experimented with a variety of programs and initiatives aimed at building and defining a unique &quot;undergraduate experience&quot; for its students, many of which are extra- or co-curricular. Additionally, the professional schools and colleges at U-M are exploring co-curricular tracks for interest-based specialties and already have a history of certificate-based programs served both in-person and online. Recently, U-M has entered into a partnership with Coursera to provide high-quality, asynchronous course-based learning experiences to learners all over the world, for free, but without robust certification.</li><li><br></li><li>Understanding how badging, reputation, and achievement systems work in these interest-based realms can help the University define its portfolio of experiences and more appropriately brand and market those according to individual needs and uses. The motivation and learning components of these systems may be the key to differentiating experiences in academic institutions. Knowing how and when to apply systems like badging or higher level credentialing (degrees) would then be crucial to diversifying the University&#x27;s programs and offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><br></li><li>But I care about the learning.</li><li><br></li><li>Learning is much more social and connected than it used to be, or maybe it&#x27;s just coming out of the trough of industrial disillusionment. Regardless, we have an opportunity to recognize the various ways learning takes place and help people make sense of that. When people understand themselves and can articulate who they are and where they want to go next, they have an easier time integrating themselves into their environment and engaging with the world.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li><li>What I want to understand is the complexity of an individual&#x27;s motivation vector around specific tasks and processes, how that vector is tied to individual identity, and how what they do creates a flurry of feedback that is then integrated back into one&#x27;s identity. This is my description of learning. And I think it&#x27;s more important for people to be able to describe who they are and show their growth than it is to show individual achievements and aspire to existing roles in society. Badge systems can help show growth and trajectory. They can be used to build contextually aware individuals with complex, yet malleable identities.</li></ul>Luka&#x27;s Notes--on Thursday after the call<br>Letter of Intent (if we want to) by August 27h--that&#x27;s priority, but rolling acceptance &amp; based on grantholder<br><br>Piet is back to work on August 20th<br><br>Eligability--from Sunny Lee, August 7 2012<br><strong>I am a former Digital Media and Learning Competition winner. Can I apply?</strong><br>No, you cannot apply as a primary applicant. However, you may contribute as a team member to a research project seeking Competition funding.<br><strong>I am already receiving funds from the Gates Foundation. Can I apply?</strong><br>Yes, but only if you are not or have not been the primary applicant for a Digital Media and Learning Competition project.<br><strong>I am already receiving funds from another source. Can I apply?</strong><br>Yes, however, any award you receive from this Competition should be applied to the part of the project that is not being funded by other sources.<br><br>Email from Luka (8&#x2F;21):<br>We had talked about looking into this trajectory question, the narrative people have of learning, how that can cut across class&#x2F;ability&#x2F;culture in general.<br><br>We know from work in traditional education that what is called your &quot;habitus&quot; (a &quot;structuring structure&quot;) impacts how and what you learn.&nbsp; Bourdieu (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pierre&#x5f;Bourdieu&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pierre_Bourdieu)</a> developed the term habitus, which is basically a taken for granted set of dispositions, taste patterns, etc. Your habitus is based on how much cultural capital you have (economic capital = money, assets; social capital = your networks; cultural capital = your education, your learned dispositions, knowing to pick up the right fork or say the right thing, etc).&nbsp; In traditional education settings, higher cultural capital students do better. I can break this down for you more later, but kind of trust me here if its not making sense.&nbsp; I&#x27;ve been really interested in understanding 1. what is cultural capital in open education 2. how is it structured and how does it structure the space 3. are there ways that AI or good design can help people learn the right cultural capital so they can succeed in the space.<br><ul class="bullet"><li>another thought I&#x27;ve had around this area is: does one&#x27;s cultural capital determine, early on, one&#x27;s access and use of open education opportunities? in other words, is &quot;open&quot; only available to those in the know? (social mobility vs. social reproduction)</li></ul><br>I think this is where we have a project. There&#x27;s already several platforms out there that use AI to determine taste patterns, like www.hunch.com.

ABM allows for interactions and complexity than traditional models&nbsp;<br>3. develop a platform&#x2F;dashboard&#x2F;interface (here&#x27;s where I need a good developer to flesh this out) that can use that prediction tool to help learners create a narrative of their learning trajectory and help them a. gain cultural capital relevant to the space b. make better informed decisions about their trajectory and<br>4.

The idea is that the self (or selves) has a loop that connects its actions with the environment and then senses and interprets any outputs from the environment. The self then analyzes what it perceives based on its understanding of standard roles it plays in society. Today&#x27;s roles are malleable and evolve over time as different cultural standards interact with each other. These roles have been adjusting dramatically as new cultural capital comes into play. So the self has a perception of its current role based on the feedback it interpreted from the environment and then it has a projected identity made up of both cultural norms and a motivational vector. Typically (always) there exists a difference between what is perceived and what is projected. This difference becomes translated into an intended action by the self. That activity then interacts with the environment and the ensuing situation results in more output to be sensed, interpreted, and analyzed. The cycle continues.<br><br>Some interesting notes:&nbsp;<br>1) our perception of the feedback we sense is often inaccurate (citations to self assessment, others?)<br>2) the standard roles we used to subscribe to are disappearing or morphing quickly<br>3) the activities we engage in in a learning environment are often structured to produce specific outcomes based on competencies within standard roles; similarly, those outcomes are assessed as a proxy for preception, essentially scaffolding the perceptual control process<br>4) if we have error between our perception of our identity and reality (delta-p), and error between role standards and our identity projections (delta-i), we end up with some error in our intended actions (delta-a); over time, we strive to reduce delta-p, hence the name &quot;perception control&quot;.<br>5) typical education systems have created a perception by-pass that forces individuals to focus on assessments of outcomes rather than our natural comparison processing of identity perception and projection. meanwhile, the education systems have not updated quickly enough to match changes in both role standards and how different roles are becoming privileged over others. so the assessments and the standards introduce more error into the control system, resulting in intentions that are completely out of line with what the environment would suggest is productive.<br>6) badges that continue down the &quot;assessment&quot; path will do nothing to affect this cycle of increasing error; in fact, assessment badges may even hasten incorrect identity shifts<br>7) we suggest badging be connected to this control system in two ways: a] use badges to help individuals make sense of the changing and multiplying roles in society (reducing delta-i); b] use badges to provide timely and relevant feedback to individuals, improving their perception and reducing perception error (delta-p).<br><br>9&#x2F;21&#x2F;12<br><br>logistics:<br><ul class="indent"><li>-DML wants us to focus on research only - no development side.&nbsp; They couldn&#x27;t answer any further than that, since it is a &quot;competition&quot;</li><li>-Do we need to name IPS as fiscal sponsor in application?&nbsp; If so, there&#x27;s a bunch of paperwork we need to do.&nbsp; Let&#x27;s talk about this.<ul class="indent"><li>- I need the name of the IPS sponsor and contact info for my grants office - EMAIL SARAH&#x27;s INFO TO PIET (Sarah Byrnes: Economic Justice Organizer at IPS); they want a 15% fee from the award</li><li>- technically graduate students cannot be PIs&#x2F;primary applicants in the DML competition; are we violating that?
