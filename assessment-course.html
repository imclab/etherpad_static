<body>Assessment of open learning<br>Stian and Monica<br><br>things to think about:<br>we need to find some good resources that are freely available on the web (no articles in closed journals&#x2F;books in the library etc).&nbsp;<br>we can write to experts to help us find these. we can also invite some experts to come to the class or talk, or di a pre-recorded talk&#x2F;interview with us<br>we have to discuss about the tools of communication. it would be interesting to try to think of ways in which we could still try to make the discourse a bit knowledge-buildingy, even though we don&#x27;t have KF ...<br>in my experience, courses that have fixed weekly tasks are more successful in retaining students than ones that are much more open-ended discussions... what kind of tasks would we like?<br>do we want to aim for the production of any kinds of artifacts during the course - things that are valuable to share with others after the course?&nbsp;<br>This might be very ambitious for a six-week course, but is there a possibility we could actually try out some of what we come up with, either with ourselves, or with other courses in P2PU? (Either while they are running, or experimenting with analysing the data from courses that have already run, etc)<br><br>We don&#x27;t have to come up with all of this before the New Year, in January there is an orientation for course organizers, during which we&#x27;ll hear from previous course organizers, experts in online facilitation will be invited in, etc, and we&#x27;ll have a chance to workshop the course outline with others. (This might have been a useful thing for new OISE faculty too :))<br><br>What kind of sign-up questions do we want.<br>- do you have any special experience &#x2F; theoretical understanding that you&#x27;d like to share with the class<br>- what do you want out of this<br><br>Two parts:<br>- getting an overview of &quot;what&#x27;s out there&quot; - the landscape<br>- a task (either in groups or as a whole class) to design an assessment for a future P2PU course &#x2F; or analyzing an existing completed course<br>- having an artifact that represents the thinking of the class, that isn&#x27;t hidden in the weekly postings<br><br>What is assessment of open learning?<br>- what is assessment?<br>- what is open?<br>- what is learning?<br>:)<br>What is the purpose of assessment?<br><br>Assessing&#x2F;analyzing the learning that takes place in courses vs. assessing a student (including their previous learning)<br>- soft skills &#x2F; hard skills. 21st Century skills.&nbsp;<br>- competency based assessment<br><br>Dividing papers, having people write summaries on the wiki. Social responsibility.&nbsp;<br><br>Future course which is almost one long research project. Result in a paper.<br><br>All builds into a book on open assessment (maybe).&nbsp;<br><br></body>
