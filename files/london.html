But we&#x27;re not in the business of just building things for money. Our processe are collaborative, and work has to be in line with our priciples and values and sometimes we will approach other people and not the other way around.&nbsp;<br><br>A product space (sandbox) - it&#x27;s not a space where people build closed software.

Not every user of the site is going to be interested in the experiment&#x2F;research side of things.&nbsp;</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; School of webcraft is a good example of an incubated project which other research grew out of.

OKFN has many enthusiastic software developers who volunteer to support the project and set up a separate instance of the Lernanta software. They make modifications to the code and ask P2PU&#x27;s Tech Lead for help with problems they run into. Some of the changes they make flow back into the Lernanta code base. After the first year of the partnership OKFN decide to switch to a different platform - a micro-blogging system - because it offers the core functionality they found to work best with their users.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>John -&gt; The scenario seems too specific, in terms of the software. We shoudl try as much as possible to keep the software in one instance, for technical reasons. Lernanta is not made for someone to run a school.</li><li>Chloe -&gt; I think it&#x27;s important to foster as many connections with other communities as possible , suggest to partners that they remain in the p2pu.org instance (beneficial to both parties - broader community)</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; it always happens that you start using one thing, until something else comes along. I don;t see it as a failure if we use one thing until something else comes along</li><li>John -&gt; in terms of bridging communities, stack overflow&#x2F;exchange&#x2F;travel do this really well - they are seperate communities, but the users are kind of connected to each other - people can see profiles, but you still need to&nbsp;</li><li>Bekka: Maybe what the scenario is actually teasing out is if a partner comes along and has dev requirements and we have limited resources can we support them to develop it further.&nbsp;</li><li>Bekka: what is the nature of the partnership we need to think more about what this entails: <em>whats the give and whats the take</em>?</li><li>Chloe -&gt; perhaps we need to have a formula for partners&#x2F;schools, which require certain things of them (user nembers, degrees of activity, a certain amount of dev time that is &quot;bought&quot;</li><li>John: stack overflow, you need to have x number of answers + y people of followers &gt; in order to start a conversation &#x2F; leveling up the more involved you get</li><li>Nadeem: beneficial if we formalize our relationships (and processes) in order to manage our resources</li><li>John -&gt;Maybe we formalise on both sides - people come to p2pu for help, and we formalise the milestones required for degrees of help. On the other end, we formalise the process of us going to other people who we might want to partner with.&nbsp;</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; We can control what paid staff do, but the reality is that not everyone in the lab space might be staff, so how do we align these people&#x27;s desires and motivations with those who are coming in and looking for someone to hack with.&nbsp;</li><li>John -&gt; this is a problem with the whole idea of consulting, because it may not align with the passions of the staff. People who do come in should bring in people to do things.</li><li>Chloe -&gt; there are models for incubators, which offer exposure and a basic living situation while something is being built. This is someting we could offer - a mentorship programme which is part of the lab.</li><li>Nadeem &gt; What if we had something like Kickstarter, i.e. I need this x ammount of people to advise&#x2F;work on an idea</li><li>Connected Mentorship &#x2F; Support for taking ideas of the ground.<ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp &gt; Yes, that&#x27;s similar to stackexchange - I like that</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="indent"><li><strong>There is some connection between this scenario, and the one below:</strong></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong><u>P2PU Sandbox</u></strong></li></ul>P2PU hosts and supports two websites. One is the stable production site that is used by most courses. The other site is more of a sandbox - it allows contributors to develop new features, run live courses to test them, and gather evidence for what works and what doesn&#x27;t. The P2PU development team moves tools from the Lab into the production site. The way Lernanta (our software) is structured makes it easy for contributors to plug new modules into it. Our development team spends a significant amount of their time helping partners build tools that plug into Lernanta. We develope few features ourselves.&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Nadeem -&gt; the inherent assumption here is that everything we do translates into a feature on the site, when there is&nbsp;</li><li>John -&gt; the permission issue is key here - a developer shouldn&#x27;t have to come and ask permission to do something on the site&#x2F;improve projects, but if something works well, it can be translated into a feature</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; there is a cultural component here, why arent people forking the codeline and doing this anyway?&nbsp; is the reason that they need an audience for the feature which is essentially what the live site gives them.</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; the question still is how wide do we cast the net&#x2F;articulate what the lab is about - Is it around peer-based learning, or something else?&nbsp;</li><li><br></li><li><strong>John -&gt;Answering the question of how we decide who gets in to the incubator and who doesn&#x27;t is going to become increasingly difficult (berlin for example - we have more applicants&#x2F;ideas than we can fund).</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; Some resources we&#x27;ll probably not run out of (time to discuss things) but finite resources, like dev time, will be more difficult to allocate.&nbsp; How do we mobilise an army of volunteers around ieas that they are seeded by individuals, matchmaking??&nbsp;</li><li>Chloe -&gt; the good hackathon example: we can match people with a passion for the mission of P2PU with people who have ideas and need help.&nbsp;</li><li>John -&gt; startup incubators are quite closed, but from the open perpective, we can look at people who want to share expertise and time&nbsp;</li><li><strong>P2PU the nerd-dating&#x2F;matchmaking site!</strong></li></ul><br><br><strong><u>Consulting</u></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>JP Morgan hires P2PU to redesign its professional&nbsp; development offerings. P2PU will work with JP Morgan staff to design a series of challenges and hosts a separate learning space for JP Morgan on our server. JP Morgan&#x27;s global community participants in courses. The courses are not open. JP Morgan is interested in the possibility of using technology to scale PD offerings to their employees. For P2PU this project offers a source of consulting income but also an opportunity to test our social learning models in a professional development context.</li><li>Nadeem -&gt; we&#x27;ve never said that we wouldn&#x27;t work with traditional universities, so would we turn away potential corporate partners? Can we occupy the space as thought leaders if we say no to some people?</li><li>Larry -&gt; one reason to say no is to think about the headlines the next day: &quot;JP Morgan does private experimentation which isn&#x27;t actually open&quot;. The reason for saying yes, means that you would need a very seperate space, with very clear defining lines and no bleed over.&nbsp;</li><li>John -&gt; 2 scenarios: the for profit, and the non profit. Would the people who do this work be volunteers or staff? If volunteers, then I say go for it - help people who want to volunteer find paid work. In the case of staff, the question is can we actually do that (open requirements in the staff contracts)<ul class="bullet"><li>I wouldn&#x27;t be ooposed to us having something that we sell to JP Morgan, but the staff of the non-profit didn&#x27;t sign up to work for JP Morgan.&nbsp;</li><li>Look at Skillshare example, partnership with GE, but backing of Maker Faire, Little Bits (Open orgs) &gt; what if coorporate partnerships were turned beneficial for our community of learners (i.e. badges backed by JP Morgan)</li></ul></li><li>Bekka: feels wrong to have something on the side the dirty little secret we dont talk about</li><li>Larry -&gt; you need to tease out the implications, move beyond the entity and see what the conditions are under which we would be happy for the agreements to be public.</li><li>John -&gt; the distinction is what comes out of it, rather than the company we may or may not work with -&nbsp;</li><li>Larry -&gt; the real test will be when this scenario really arises, and the questions have to be asked in each specific case, and make specific calls, and it&#x27;s good to have general ideas, but each scenario will have specifc issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Larry: More likely that companies that are forming to disrupt education would approach us as experts in the area: its a closer example than JP Moran.</li></ul><br><strong>Scenario Variation</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>What if there was a partner we felt was more aligned with our values?<ul class="bullet"><li>Nadeem -&gt; regardless of who the potential partner is, we need to be better at knowing what we&#x27;re delivering, and making sure that we get what we need to out of the partnership<ul class="bullet"><li>It&#x27;s hard to predict in advance what these scenarios might look like&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Chloe -&gt; we also must remember that everything we do has to have some impact on peer learning and the assessment&#x2F;accreditation&#x2F;learning models that we&#x27;ve been working on</li><li><strong>Key criteria for making decisions on partnership &#x2F; consulting projects&nbsp;</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Reputation from being associated with a very well respected brand</li><li>Exposure &#x2F; marketing - we get traffic through the partners</li><li>Motivation for new community members to join &gt; get certification from industry stakeholders</li><li>Aligns with our core values as a community</li><li>QUALITY of materials &gt; we offer highly valuable challenges&#x2F;courses</li><li>Ability to re-us the work we do (open source code) or the learning that has happened</li><li>Buy in from community</li><li>Does it help us move the field &#x2F; conversation forward?<ul class="bullet"><li>I think as long as we approach it as bridging the barrier between higher education&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Does it provide an attractive sustainability opportunity?</li><li>Assessment should be driven by the community (as written in the white paper) and aligned with what the industry needs and this is something that should be remembered when we think about these partnerships</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Who is Our Community&#x2F; Who Might Our Customers Be?</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>&quot;Customer&quot; -&gt; Who do we focus on?
