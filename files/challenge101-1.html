<body><strong><u># Make a Plan for your Challenge</u></strong><br><br><strong>Description:</strong> Get ready to design your first challenge.<br><br><strong>Gear</strong>: paper, post-its and markers, digital camera.<br><br><strong>Time:</strong> 2 hours<br><br><strong><u>## Task 1 - Are Challenges for you?</u></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>your learning model is asynchronous -- learners can move through the material at their own pace, etc.</li><li>you hope to scale your teaching effects beyond the capacities of any single teacher.</li></ul><br><strong><u>## Task 2 Introduce yourself</u></strong><br><br><br><strong><u>## Task 3 What is the problem you are asking your peers to solve?</u></strong><br><em>Ask your peers a question that allows for multiple answers and interpretations</em><br><br>Think of a question that you want your peers to be able to answer by the end of your challenge. Write it down and pick one that you feel is closer to the big picture you drew in the previous task. For example, <em>&quot;how does the web work?&quot;</em>&nbsp; Remember the question you selected should allow for multiple interpretations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u>## Task&nbsp; 3- What do you want them to understand by solving this problem</u></strong><br><em>Write down what you would like your learners to be able to understand by the end of the challenge.</em><br><br>Start by asking yourself; what is the big picture -- the really big picture (!) -- for this challenge? If you have a hard time coming up with one, then you can get started by writing down a few key words or phrases on a piece of paper or post-its; for example; <em>cookies, chocolate chip</em>, <em>crispy, chewy</em>.&nbsp; Try drawing a sketch of what these key words mean to you or a diagram of how they interact with each other.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u>## Task 4 - What are the skills you want them to get out of this</u></strong><br><em>Write down what you would like your learners to be able to do by the end of the challenge</em><br><br>It is time to write down what you would like your learners to be able to do by the end of the challenge. Think of skills in a 21st century way and connect them to both mastery of a specific piece of content, but also add skills such as &quot;critical thinking&quot;, &quot;filtering information&quot;, &#8220;working in a team&#8221;, &#8220;problem solving&#8221; and &#8220;design thinking.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u># Task 5 -Create a pitch!</u></strong><br><em>Create a pitch for your challenge and share with your peers</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Use what you came up with above to create a pitch for your idea. You can write your pitch into a paragraph, make a poster, a song or even a video. Be creative with it and remember that it needs to hook people into taking your challenge and clearly explain why they should take this challenge as well as what they will be doing and making during the challenge. A rule of thump is to ask yourself after looking at your pitch; &quot;would I want to take this challenge if it wasn&#x27;t mine?&quot;<br><br>In the meantime here are some tips to help you out.<br><br><strong>Tip # 1:</strong> Make sure that your pitch creates concrete expectations for the outcomes of the challenge. Your objectives should be simple to understand yet challenging to accomplish, in order for the learners to be motivated enough to go through it.<br><br><strong>Tip # 2: </strong>You might want to include explicit &#8220;after this challenge&#8221; language (aka &#8220;The Payoff&#8221; or &#8220;Victory&#8221;) that describes skill and knowledge gain in non-technical terms. For example you can say something like &#8220;you will be able to &#8230;&#8221; &#8220;build simple web pages&#8221;, &#8220;integrate video into a page&#8217; , &#8220;learn how to work with others&#8221;, &#8220;become a mentor.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Tip # 3: Keep your pitch SHORT &amp; SWEET</strong><br><br><br><strong><u>## Task 5 - Give feedback to your peers</u></strong><br><em>Leave comments on&nbsp; some of your peers blogs</em><br><br>You can&#x27;t consider this challenge finished until you have left comments on&nbsp; some of your peers blogs. Here are some questions to guide you when you are leaving suggestions on your peers posts;<br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Is their &quot;challenging question&quot; challenging enough? Does it allow for multiple answers and interpretations?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you see some skills your peers could add to their mind map?</li></ul>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;<br><br>================<br>Community Feedback<br>================<br>Step 0 : &quot;is this for you?&quot; task&#x2F;questionairre &#x2F;&#x2F; maybe challenges are not for everyone.<br>i think step 0 goes in the parent etherpad (.&#x2F;challenge101) yes, good idea editing right now<br><br>Examples;&nbsp;<br><br>Task #1 What do I want them to get out of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Add examples&nbsp;<br><br>Help kids explore their creativity<br>Help kids to understand what a programming language is<br>Work in a team<br><br>Task #2 Instead methods<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What are you teaching?
