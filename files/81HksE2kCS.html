<body>We&#8217;re moving!<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; the long-awaited migration from the old P2PU site to our lovely new&nbsp;&nbsp; home is almost upon us, and we&#8217;re really excited. Our new site is&nbsp;&nbsp; sleeker and better looking, but more importantly, it&#8217;s better geared to&nbsp;&nbsp; facilitating peer to peer learning.&nbsp; (how?) (why is it good?)<br><br>We&#8217;re&nbsp;&nbsp; hoping that this new site will be the base from which the P2PU&nbsp;&nbsp; community can continue to leverage the internet and educational&nbsp;&nbsp; materials openly available online and enable high-quality, low-cost&nbsp;&nbsp; education opportunities for as many people has we can reach.<br><br><strong>[this section needs to be fleshed out]</strong><br><br>P2PU - learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything.&nbsp;<br><br>====LONGER SECTION TO BE ADDED TO MAILER&#x2F;BLOG POST ETC====<br><strong>How to get started</strong><br>If&nbsp;&nbsp; you&#8217;re new to P2PU, the best way to get started is to create an&nbsp;&nbsp; account. If you&#8217;ve already registered, even on the old site, then you&nbsp;&nbsp; should have an account already set up.<br>Once&nbsp;&nbsp; you have an account, you can use the My P2PU link in the top right&nbsp;&nbsp; corner of the page to manage your profile and view any messages you may&nbsp;&nbsp; have.&nbsp; We recommend that you add a photo and plenty of detail to your&nbsp;&nbsp; profile, so that people can see who you are and what you&#8217;re interested&nbsp;&nbsp; in learning.<br><strong>What happened to the Front Page?</strong><br>Like&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook or Twitter and many other sites, the new P2PU site doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;&nbsp; have a front page, like the old one did. Instead, every time you log&nbsp; on,&nbsp; you will find yourself on your dashboard. From here you can track&nbsp; the&nbsp; activity in groups that you are a part of, or you can use the&nbsp; Learn,&nbsp; People, Schools and Blog links across the top of the page to&nbsp; find&nbsp; groups, view people&#8217;s profiles and follow them, explore the&nbsp; Schools that&nbsp; are part of P2PU or visit our blog.<br><strong>Join the Help Desk</strong><br>Think&nbsp;&nbsp; of the help desk as a 24 hour, 365 day a year orientation. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp; place where all the &#8220;how to&#8221; info about the new site is kept, and&nbsp;&nbsp; shared, and where you can ask any questions you may have.&nbsp; Have a look&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Tasks section of the helpdesk for some great screencasts and&nbsp;&nbsp; discussions on the best ways to start learning.<br><strong>Find a course or study group</strong><br>Now&nbsp;&nbsp; that you&#8217;ve got your account all up and running, it&#8217;s time to learn!&nbsp;&nbsp; Your can browse all the current courses and study groups that are under&nbsp;&nbsp; development, newly open,&nbsp; and already running by clicking on the&nbsp; &#8220;Learn&#8221;&nbsp; link at the top of your dashboard. This will show you all the&nbsp; courses&nbsp; and groups, and their status.<br><br><strong>Create your own course or study group</strong><br>If you&#8217;d like to create your own course or group, have a look at this great screencast how-to.<br><br><strong>Find materials from old courses that ran on the previous site</strong><br>If&nbsp;&nbsp; you were a participant in, or organiser of a course on the previous&nbsp;&nbsp; site, and you can&#8217;t find it on the new one, never fear! You can import&nbsp;&nbsp; the material directly using this great tool:&nbsp; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;new&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;import&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;import&#x2F;</a><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></body>
