<body>Badges and Assessment (part 1 of 3)<br><br>In August Mark Surman wrote an enticing post entitled <em>Experiment: Badges, identity and you</em> (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;commonspace&#x2e;wordpress&#x2e;com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;badges&#x2d;identity&#x2d;and&#x2d;you&#x2F;&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonspace.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;badges-identity-and-you&#x2F;)</a>. Fast forward a month and in comes me, Joshua Gay (hello!). I&#x27;ve come on board to work on two projects: to help develop the badge <em>backpack</em> as well as to work with P2PU.org to experiment with peer-based educational assessment. The relationship between the two is simple: some peer-based assessments on P2PU will result in students being given digital badges; these badges will then get stored in a digital &#x27;&#x27;backpack&#x27;&#x27;.&nbsp;<br><br>Seems simple enough, right? Well, that&#x27;s what I thought as well, until I started really looking into each of these ideas. What I discovered is that there are a great number of tantalizing questions, exciting implications, and possible implemenations of badges, a badge backpack, and of peer-based assessment models. So, as a sort of status report to the community, I&#x27;ve put together a series of three posts, of which this is the first.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Badges, badges, everywhere</strong><br><br>Once you start to think about badges in both your digital and analog lives, you realize that they turn up all over the place. In the physical world some examples of where badges are awarded are:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Military and police forces have medals and isignia of sorts to recognize merit and rank;&nbsp;</li><li>Many martial arts programs award belts and stripes;</li><li>And perhaps most famously, within the Scouting movement (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scouting&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scouting)</a>, there are organizations all over the world that provide badges to that signify various forms of skills earned or to signify that&nbsp; right of passage has been made.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Perhaps my favorite example of a badge system that I&#x27;ve come across is the&nbsp; <em>Peace Corps Merit Badges</em> (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;peacecorpsmeritbadges&#x2e;com&#x2F;&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peacecorpsmeritbadges.com&#x2F;)</a>. You can read about the badge below in the story, <em>Peace Corps OLPC Merit Badge: Hardest Badge You&#x27;ll Ever Earn</em> (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;olpcnews&#x2e;com&#x2F;people&#x2F;volunteers&#x2F;peace&#x5f;corps&#x5f;olpc&#x5f;merit&#x5f;badge&#x5f;h&#x2e;html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olpcnews.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;volunteers&#x2F;peace_corps_olpc_merit_badge_h.html</a> ).&nbsp;<br><br>IMAGE: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;olpcnews&#x2e;com&#x2F;images&#x2F;olpc&#x2d;badge&#x2e;jpg">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olpcnews.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;olpc-badge.jpg</a><br><br>In the digital world, badges can be found across all sorts of sites and networks, some examples are:&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>The MMORPG &#x27;&#x27;World of Warcraft&#x27;&#x27; offers myriad badges throughout its many worlds.&nbsp;</li><li>StackOverflow.com, is a collaborative Q&amp;A site that makes creative use of badges to encourage and reward participation (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow&#x2e;com&#x2F;badges&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;badges)</a>.</li><li>The news aggregation site, Slashdot.org awards achievements related to comments, posts, and various uses of the site (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;slashdot&#x2e;org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;accounts&#x2e;shtml&#x23;ac1300">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slashdot.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;accounts.shtml#ac1300</a> ).&nbsp;</li></ul><br>One of my goals in exploring badges across these wildly different contexts is to understand what the commonalities are amongst badges. Our goal of course is to construct a general placeholder that any organization could use to describe their badge.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Badge Semantics</strong><br><br>&lt;blockquote&gt;<br>Shrek: Ogres are like onions.<br>Donkey: They stink?<br>Shrek: Yes. No.<br>Donkey: Oh, they make you cry.<br>Shrek: No.<br>Donkey: Oh, you leave em out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin&#x27; little white hairs.<br>Shrek: NO. Layers. Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. [sighs]<br>Donkey: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. You know, not everybody like onions.&nbsp;<br>&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;<br><br>Like Ogres, onions (and parfait), badges, too, have many layers.&nbsp;<br><br>The first layer I have unravelled are basically the five W&#x27;s of a badge, which are:&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Who earned the badge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>What does it signify</li><li>When was it acquired.</li><li>Where was it given.&nbsp;</li><li>Why was it given.</li></ul><br>These five properties seem to be common across most badges. But, as you would expect, badges often get slightly more complex and can have more layers of meaning. Some of the ones I&#x27;ve come across are:&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Value - some organizations associate a value (points, karma, etc) with a badge. This value may be used to distinguish the relative &quot;worth&quot; of badges or the aggregate worth of your badges may unlock certain activities or be used as a way to compare members of a group.&nbsp;</li><li>Insigniary (stripes or sub-badges) - sometimes badges can be modified with additional insigniary over time. For example, this could be adding stripes to indicate a &quot;level&quot; (or counter) at which you have earned a given rank or badge, to indicate that you&#x27;ve earned a badge more than once, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Version - Some badges are part of version control systems and come with a release number.&nbsp;</li><li>External URLs - Sometimes a badge may link to URLs to show exactly where or for what you earned a badge.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Finally, the other layer of badges I have discovered have to do with the relative meaning of badges. For example:&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Dependencies - What badges are first required before you can earn this badge?&nbsp;</li><li>Groups - Is this badge part of a larger group of badges?&nbsp;</li><li>Unlocked properties - Often when you earn a badge it unlocks the ability to pursue other badges or partake in other activities in an organization or on a given system.&nbsp;</li></ul><br><strong>Badge Syntax</strong><br><br>As we begin to sort through the various semantic properties we might use to characterize any given badge, we are also looking toward different ways to represent our badges syntactically. A few of open data formats that have come up in discussion thusfar include microformats, RDF&#x2F;RDFa, and ATOM.&nbsp;<br><br>Ultimately our goal is to make it easy for other projects and individuals to create, award, share, and display badges. The biggest challenge we face in representing badges is not going to be representing the basic five W&#x27;s, but, rather, the meaning of the badge as it relates to the context in which it was granted as well as the meaning of the badges relative to one another.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of the leading questions we have come-up with are:&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>How do we represent a group of badges?</li><li>How do we represent badge dependencies?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the various kinds of URI&#x27;s that should be supported by a badge?&nbsp;</li></ul><br>The context we are asking ourselves these questions is that we want to think about how projects can make use of badges. How can they be used? How, why, when, and to whom will you display your badges?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Next Steps</strong><br><br>So, now that I have you thinking about badges, let me know what you think. I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on badges; on ideas of how to represent badges; and to get any other questions you might have.&nbsp;<br><br>In our next segment we will be exploring badges further in the context of educational assessment and P2PU.org.&nbsp;<br><br><br>********************************************************************************************<br><br>Badges and Assessment (part 2 of 3)<br><br>In our first segment we explored the general idea of badges. We discussed various examples of where they appeard in the physical and virtual world. Then we attempted to begin listing the various semantic properties badges have as well as briefly touching upon thoughts on the syntactic representation of badges.&nbsp;<br><br>In this segment, we will explore badges in the context of our experiments in educational assessment on P2PU.org.&nbsp;<br><br>OUTLINE OF POST<br><br><br>Motivation; assessment OVERVIEW, IDEAS, MOTIVATIONS<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Overview of P2PU, School of Webcraft, big goals.&nbsp;</li><li>What assessment is; what assessment is not.

Think of it as online book&nbsp; clubs for open educational resources. The P2PU helps you navigate the&nbsp; wealth of open education materials that are out there, creates small&nbsp; groups of motivated learners, and supports the design and facilitation&nbsp; of courses. Students and tutors get recognition for their work, and we&nbsp; are building pathways to formal credit as well.<br><br>But, P2PU can also be thought of as a experimentation platform. This is&nbsp; because we are breaking new ground and will be constantly building and&nbsp; improving our system to adapt to the needs of the using community. To&nbsp; figure out what works, and what doesn&#x27;t work, we will need to experiment&nbsp; as we go.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the current experiments we are working on is that of educational&nbsp; assessment models and recognitions that can be mapped onto the P2PU&nbsp; platform. Another experiment we have going is the use of badges on the&nbsp; P2PU system. These two experiments intersect when a badge is rewarded as&nbsp; an outcome of a particular assessment taking place.&nbsp;<br><br>To give a concrete example, imagine you have identified the skill of&nbsp; being able to give helpful responses in discussion threads. One way we&nbsp; could imagine assessing this skill is to have peers rank or critique&nbsp; student responses within discussion threads. With a little imagination,&nbsp; you could imagine that if a student has received enough positive&nbsp; responses of a certain nature and in a certain context that this could&nbsp; indicate that it is likely a student has achieved some level of&nbsp; competency at the skill were were trying to assess. As a result, that&nbsp; student is rewarded with the &quot;helpful responder badge.&quot;&nbsp;<br><br>This experiment itself is interesting and it is certainly one we will be&nbsp; pursuing. But, let&#x27;s imagine we bring it a step further. Imagine if&nbsp; once you have received the &quot;helpful responder badge&quot;, you suddenly find&nbsp; out that you have unlocked other assessment models and abilities of&nbsp; acquiring new badges you didn&#x27;t&#x27; have before.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point, you may be thinking that things are starting to get&nbsp; really exciting, or perhaps you are thinking they are starting to get&nbsp; really scary! In either case, these kinds of creative and interesting&nbsp; use of badges and assessment leave us with many exciting possibilities&nbsp; and experiments to conduct.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, our goal is to begin awarding badges across some of our courses that are part of the School of Webcraft.&nbsp; But, the outstanding question is how and when will we award these&nbsp; badges? If we award them, will they be helping us to authenticate&nbsp; learning outcomes and if so, should we also use badges for other reasons&nbsp; such as to motivate student engagement or as a sort of administrative&nbsp; filtering tool?&nbsp;<br><br>When I think of many and varied uses of Badges, one of the first thing that comes to mind is the US Military.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>US Military Badges</strong><br><br><br>In the US Military their are all sorts of ribbons, badges,&nbsp; and medals. The meaning of each is extremely context sensitive. Some&nbsp; badges or ribbons are relevant only to a particular Unit, some indicate&nbsp; skills, achievement, merit, or are awarded simply because you happened&nbsp; to do something (like go overseas). And yet some go across all&nbsp; boundaries, for example, members across all branches of the uniformed&nbsp; services are encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of&nbsp; Honor as a matter of respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, look at variety and complexity of accoutrement on this sailor&#x27;s uniform:&nbsp;<br><br><br>IMAGE: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;upload&#x2e;wikimedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;en&#x2F;9&#x2F;97&#x2F;Navy&#x5f;Ribbons&#x5f;and&#x5f;Badges&#x2e;jpg">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;en&#x2F;9&#x2F;97&#x2F;Navy_Ribbons_and_Badges.jpg</a><br><br><br><strong>The P2PU Take-away</strong><br>I think that as we begin to figure out how to integrate badges&nbsp; into the P2PU system we can learn a lot about the sophisticated use of&nbsp; these various accoutrement in the US Military.&nbsp;<br><br>In particular, I think that we can have different uses of badges across&nbsp; the system, even if at times the use of badges might be for totally&nbsp; different reasons (some of which may even seem in opposition with one&nbsp; another). But, in order to pull it off, special attention will be need&nbsp; to be paid to three different aspects of badges.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>&nbsp; Visual display of badges.</strong>&nbsp; The size, complexity of design, and the relative layout of badges are&nbsp; all going to contribute to how people interpret and understand them. I&nbsp; think if we make visually distinct types of badges and allow for them to&nbsp; be grouped in different ways then people will be able to immediately&nbsp; tell when a badge relates to their serious learning goals or when it is&nbsp; simply being used as a filter or hoop to ensure a person is not a bot or&nbsp; is actually going to commit to something.&nbsp;<br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp; Context, label, and process of being awarded a badge</strong>. If you are going along the system and all of a sudden a box slides out and states, &quot;You have earned the helpful responder <em>ribbon</em>&nbsp; because five people have found your comments to be helpful; you now&nbsp; have the ability to flag some posts as SPAM&quot; and then the box slides&nbsp; back down, you might smile and go on with your day. But, on the other&nbsp; hand, if you received a full page notice and email explaining why and&nbsp; how you were awarded the &quot;Community Leader Merit <em>Badge</em>.&quot;&nbsp; This might give you pause and encourage you to reflect upon both your&nbsp; personal learning goals and your past and present experiences in your&nbsp; course of learning.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Relative meaning of badges. </strong>As&nbsp; soon as a sufficiently large number of badges begin to be created both&nbsp; on our system and on other systems their will be an increased need for&nbsp; people to begin comparing badges in various ways. If we know this going&nbsp; into it we can encourage people to create comparison grids or to&nbsp; organize their badges in ways that make clear how and when a badge is&nbsp; rewarded and what the (as a programmer might say) the various&nbsp; preconditions and postconditions are for a given badge.&nbsp;<br><br><br>But Does This Actually Work?<br><br>Of course, it is easy to go through this kind of a deconstruction&nbsp; exercises on military badges and then simply attempt to apply the&nbsp; salient principles you draw from this and apply them to P2PU in the&nbsp; abstract. But, the question remains, will badges still work as we try to&nbsp; achieve our goals of building an assessment system in P2PU?&nbsp;<br><br>I think that in order to answer this question we need to ask more refined questions. For example, we could ask, <em>will&nbsp; the more &quot;game-like&quot; uses of badges that simply unlock functionality&nbsp; for users interfere with badges that are associated with formative&nbsp; assessment and recognition?</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>The answer is that we don&#x27;t know. But, that&#x27;s OK. Coming-up with&nbsp; these kinds of refined questions are essential for us to be able to&nbsp; conduct effective and meaningful experiments through the P2PU platform.<br><br>Over the next few weeks we will be awarding a few badges in our School&nbsp; of Webcraft courses. As we do so, this will hopefully give us a first&nbsp; opportunity to both put this question to the test as well as to begin&nbsp; experimenting with how we display and present badges to users.&nbsp;<br><br>This experimentation will continue through the fall and winter and as we&nbsp; begin to build more sophistication into our Badge system and our P2PU&nbsp; platform so too will we be able to perform more sophisticated&nbsp; experiments in this area.&nbsp;<br><br>Lastly, we are not doing this alone. We are also hoping to work closely&nbsp; with groups such as Remix Learning and MAKE Magazine who are also&nbsp; interested in offering badges on their systems and to their&nbsp; communities.&nbsp; The coming months should be exciting and we welcome you&nbsp; will join us in all the fun!<br><br></body>
