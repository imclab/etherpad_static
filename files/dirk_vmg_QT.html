<body>Monday, September 10<br><br>Mozilla open badges--send to backpack<br>review a badge--not disabled<br><br>Course Creation Research<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Optimizely: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;optimizely&#x2e;com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.optimizely.com&#x2F;</a></li></ul><br>Assessment<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;p&#x2F;vanessa">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;vanessa</a><br><br>Bigger Questions:<br><ul class="bullet"><li><br></li></ul><br>From Dirk:<br>II.<br>- This section seems a little short since these are the problems that<br>we are trying to address. I&#x27;m guessing you may have done so on purpose<br>though, so not a big problem for me<br>- Complexity: is this really a problem? Mostly for badge creators or<br>for learners when they need to apply&#x2F;review?<br><br>III.<br>- Will badges be decoupled from courses and schools? I kind of like<br>the idea of badges not being specific to a single course or school<br>- How do we determine if a users is experienced?<br>- I like the idea of skills being more prominent. Maybe we should<br>limit tags to skills or rebrand tags as skills? They both can also<br>coexist.<br>-- Something like searching for courses by skills could be a good way<br>for people to find courses<br>-- Showing &quot;Learn more than 1000+ skills online with your peers&quot; and<br>some popular skills on the homepage can be good for PR<br>- There&#x27;s a missing &quot;are&quot; in &quot;There definitely experts among us&quot;<br>- I don&#x27;t completely understand the expert user pop-up box - is it<br>some way to ensure that a user is actually an expert?<br><br>IV.<br>- Will skills be tied to content&#x2F;schedule? &quot;skill acquired by week&quot;<br>- Does course creation and badges correlate? Are badges created inside a course?<br>- Should learners see all the skill that they can learn in a course?<br>- Would skills acquired in a course be limited to the skills defined<br>by the course?<br><br>V.<br>- Should we introduce the concept of groups&#x2F;cohorts at the same time<br>as assessment?<br><br>VI.<br>- Can we maybe show an example of what the visualization would look<br>like? Would it take manual input or would the skills graph be<br>automatically generated?<br>-- I like this idea!<br>- Does this correlate in some way to the &quot;Knowledge map&quot; from Khan Academy?<br><br>VII.<br>- Great feedback from excellent people!<br>- Where is the &quot;why is this plan an improvement&quot; section that Allan mentions?<br><br>General:<br>- How do we display evidence for badges?<br>- Do we show evidence per skill?<br>- Are skills 0&#x2F;1? IOW, does it take only 1 peer to believe that I<br>mastered&#x2F;have a skill?<br>- Does being tagged with a skill mean that: &quot;I mastered the skill&quot;,<br>&quot;Discussed the skill&quot;, &quot;Improved on the skill&quot;?<br>- Sounds like there is an expert user role that&#x27;s not being explained<br>by this plan? Something like a user that makes an independent<br>assessment of a users skills who&#x27;s feedback we can use to test the<br>effectiveness of this plan?<br><br></body>
