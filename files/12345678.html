<body>Chloe Notes on What makes a good Challenge 08&#x2F;29&#x2F;2011<br>What makes a good challenge?&nbsp;<br>Simple setup- complex problem: The challenge uses a simple setup that requires learners to find the solution to a complex problem. For example- in the &quot;Bring it all together&quot;&nbsp; challenge learners have to create a portfolio site (simple setup) but the problem they have to solve has many layers (complex). they have to sketch-&nbsp; design and develop wireframes to build their portfolio site.<br>Taking on a role: learners take on an identity or a multiple set of identities such as&nbsp; programmer- collaborator- activist- ice cream lover. In so doing they become committed to the space and the community in which the&nbsp; complex learning challenge is situated.<br>Having a &quot;need to know&quot;: The challenge is meaningful for the learner audience. There is a need for them to master the skills required to complete the challenge. For example there is a personal motivation for the learners- such as creating your own portfolio site- or a community related one- such as leveling up and becoming a Guru&#x2F;Mentor or winning a competition among the community- and even a fun factor such as a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge.&nbsp; A need to know could be designed as a combination of some&#x2F;all of the above. In doing so the learners find the challenge meanigful and personally fulfilling.<br>Belonging to a larger context : challenges level up and are grouped together in what could be called a Quest- Mission- etc. The architecture of the Quest&#x2F;Mission allows for one to take linear or non-linear learning paths. For example in the Webmaking 101 -let&#x27;s name it - Quest- a user can take some challenges through a linear path (as they appear- first- second-third etc) and other challenges through non-linear paths (like a choose your own adventure)<br>Clear goals:&nbsp; the challenge&#x2F; or group of challenges has a clear overall goal- such as building a portfolio. A challenge goal can consist of smaller goals or combinations- such as building a portfolio site- winning badges-&nbsp; getting community credit etc<br>Receiving feedback along the way: Learners receive feedback on their actions as they progress through the challenge or a group of challenges. (this could be were badges-points- progress map etc come in) For example-(from the top of my head) in the Better- Faster- Stronger&nbsp; challenge- the learner get&#x27;s feedback on the time taken for his&#x2F; her&nbsp; portfolio content to load. A key idea here is that of a feedback loop. That allows users based on the challenge assessment to redo their previous action or take a new action based on the assessment.<br>Smart tools: Moving through levels of the challenge unlocks smart tools.&nbsp; A smart tool is something a learner can use again and again in other challenges. For example- Firebug (if Firebug was to be unlocked as a tool after completing challenge x) is a type of smart tool.<br>There is risk-taking and exploration. Learners are encouraged to take risks- explore- and try new things (trial and error). For example- in the Mish Mash challenge you have to create grids to lay out your work and there might be several sizes of grids that you can create- so during the process you might tinker with many grid sizes (trial)- make a couple of ugly layouts(error) until you find the one that works best. Note: something to think about is how we create a SAFE space for trial and error to happen and even been celebrated.&nbsp;<br>Flow: Learners feel that there is flow in the experience- meaning that the challenge tasks are doable- but increasingly challenging. Balanced scaffolding(related to flow) scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a challenge that- if too difficult- could prevent them from moving forward. However- it&#x27;s important not to build in so much scaffolding that users can get through the challenge without actually&nbsp; learning anything (ref&nbsp; Hussain- Taib)<br>A sense of agency: Learners feel a real sense of agency and control over what they are learning and doing in the challenge. For example- there could be an ability to edit some challenges and remix them or a requirement to create your own challenge after completing this first course&#x2F;quest&#x2F;mission.<br>There are many solutions to the same problem:&nbsp; different users can solve the same problem in different ways. Being&nbsp; able to compare the different solutions is equally important. (this&nbsp; concept ties to Replayability- see below)<br>Fun and Replay ability: the challenges are so enjoyable that users will re-play certain ones that lead to different outcomes or allow them to pledge higher expertise (maybe a guru version of a badge). Adding a layer of community competition to this fact- such as a &#x27;code-off&#x27; in the I heart command line challenge for example- increases the replayability of the challenge.
