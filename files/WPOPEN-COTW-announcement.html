In celebration of Open Access Week, we invite you to join us in improving two Wikipedia articles this week:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Open Access Week: We should have plenty of new news coverage to draw from in improving this article</li><li>Creative Commons license: Let&#8217;s make sure this central article is thorough and accurate; we will consider splitting off sub-articles, etc.</li></ul>For those new to Wikipedia, you&#8217;ll find some tips to get you started on our &#8220;welcome&#8221; page.<br><br>Then, just get to work on the &#8220;Open Access Week&#8221; and &#8220;Creative Commons license&#8221; articles! Be sure to check each article&#8217;s talk page (you&#8217;ll find the tab in the upper left), because we&#8217;ll surely be discussing what needs to be improved and how we want to approach it as the <strong>&#8220;WikiProject Open Collaboration of the Week&#8221; </strong>(COTW) gets underway.<br><br>In recent years, Collaboration of the Week programs have been implemented by a number of wiki communities. Academic studies have found them to be a highly effective way to keep people engaged and productive, in addition to building a sense of community. We hope you will join us as we launch this program, and help us improve Wikipedia&#8217;s coverage of important topics in the world of openness!<br><br></body>
