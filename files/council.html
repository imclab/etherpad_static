Will the organization specifically serve low-income people?</strong><br><br><strong>YES (see details below)</strong><br><br><br><strong>2. Have you prepared a three year budget?</strong><br><br><strong>YES</strong><br><br><br><strong>3. Has a board of directors been selected?</strong><br><br><strong>P2PU is not incorporated and wishes to incorporate as a 501c3 company with non-profit status in California.</strong><br><br><strong>The five co founders will be directors in the new company.</strong><br><br><strong>(I don&#x27;t think we need to provide a draft outline of expectations and responsibilities in this application)</strong><br><br><br><strong>4. Does the organization have a name?</strong><br><br><strong>YES</strong><br><br><br><strong>5. Has fiscal sponsorship already been considered and determined unbeneficial to the organization?</strong><br><br><strong>We have investigated options for fiscal sponsorship, but were unable to identify a suitable fiscal sponsor whose mission was aligned with P2PU and whose structure was designed to support a global online education project like P2PU.</strong><br><br><br><strong>6. Have you prepared a three year fundraising plan?</strong><br><br><strong>TODO: Provide input to the draft strategy plan &#x2F; sustainability section [Joel, Neeru, Delia, Stian]</strong><br><br><strong>If you answered yes to all of these questions, you may be eligible for free legal assistance from one of our volunteer attorneys.&nbsp; To continue with the process, please provide us with the additional following information:</strong><br><br><strong>a. Name of the organization</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Peer 2 Peer University P2PU</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>b. Name, title, address, and contact information</strong><br><br><strong>Is this something the lawyers would also do? Check if we can use Aspiration&#x27;s street address [Philipp to ask Gunner]&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>c. Mission statement</strong><br><br><strong>The&nbsp; Peer 2 Peer University is a grassroots open education project that&nbsp; organizes learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners&nbsp; recognition for their achievements. P2PU creates a model for lifelong&nbsp; learning alongside traditional formal higher education. Leveraging the&nbsp; internet and educational materials openly available online, P2PU enables&nbsp; learning for everyone, by everyone about almost anything.</strong><br><br><strong>The&nbsp; following values and principles are the foundation of P2PU: openness,&nbsp; community, peer learning. We are articulating these values in order to&nbsp; guide our actions, but P2P has always been about doing, and our actions&nbsp; will in turn help us probe and refine these values.</strong><br><br><strong>P2PU&nbsp; is open: Open sharing and collaboration enable participation,&nbsp; innovation, and accountability. Our community is open so that everyone&nbsp; can participate. Our content is open so that everyone can use it. Our&nbsp; model and technology are open to enable experimentation and ongoing&nbsp; improvement. And our processes are open so that we are accountable to&nbsp; our community.</strong><br><br><strong>P2PU&nbsp; is a community: P2PU is a community-centric project and our governance&nbsp; model reflects that. P2PU is driven by volunteers, who are involved in&nbsp; all aspects of the project. As members of this community, we speak and&nbsp; act with civility, tolerance, and respect for other opinions, people,&nbsp; and perspectives. We strive for quality as a community driven process of&nbsp; review, feedback and revision.</strong><br><br><strong>P2PU&nbsp; is passionate about peer learning: P2PU is teaching and learning by&nbsp; peers for peers. Everyone has something to contribute and everyone has&nbsp; something to learn. We are all teachers and we are all learners. We take&nbsp; responsibility for our own and each others learning.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>d. Description of how the organization directly serves the low income community</strong><br><br><strong>P2PU&nbsp; serves low-income people in several ways. First, by curating open&nbsp; courses, which only link to resources that are freely available on the&nbsp; internet, we enable anyone with an internet connection to easily find&nbsp; materials for self-study in a wide variety of subjects.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Second,&nbsp; by running these free courses with facilitators and a cohort, we&nbsp; provide a social structure, feedback, deadlines and a network of mentors&nbsp; to support learners at all levels excel in their chosen areas.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Thirdly,&nbsp; by experimenting with accreditation, we enable learners to access both&nbsp; further education at a lower cost, and gain employment. This happens&nbsp; through two different pathways, one is creating pathways to gaining&nbsp; credit from the existing systems, through for example recognition of&nbsp; prior learning, challenge exams or innovative partnerships with&nbsp; extension schools at recognized universities.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>We&nbsp; are also experimenting with brand new ways of demonstrating learning&nbsp; directly to employers, using digital portfolios, community reputation&nbsp; and badges. Our current focus is the School of Webcraft, in&nbsp; collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation, to provide training leading&nbsp; to employment for open web developers. We are hoping to expand this to&nbsp; other domains in the future.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Finally,&nbsp; our goal is not only a P2PU which can serve low-income people in these&nbsp; ways, but an ecosystem of resources, services and communities that make&nbsp; education and accreditation available to everyone. To achieve this, we&nbsp; promote experimentation and knowledge sharing among different projects,&nbsp; and bring people together around research and development in the open learning field.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>e. Annual operating budget</strong><br><br><strong>TODO: Use combination of Finances spreadsheet (in dropbox) and three year budget [Philipp to prepare once three year budget finalised with input]</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>f. Legal need(s) &#8211; Describe in detail</strong><br><br><strong>Incorporation as 501 company - drafting and finalising articles and by laws etc&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Act as company agent</strong><br><strong>Review and redraft as necessary P2PU terms of use, privacy policy and copyright notice</strong><br><strong>Draft collaboration agreements with other organizations</strong><br><strong>Apply for appropriate trade marks for P2PU</strong><br><br><strong>DB These are our immediate needs.
