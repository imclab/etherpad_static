<body>Creating a course &#x2F; learning project needs to be made clearer. The current structure of the course panel is very long and can be intimidating to read through. The new site should make use of tabbed information and JQuery features to break up the creation and management process into either steps or relevant sections. For now a simple way of tidying this up will be to provide sub headings for different sections and linking to them from the top of the page so users can navigate more quickly.<br><br>I&#x27;ve also added a couple of extra fields about project type, project status &#x2F; help request, proposed meeting times etc etc.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x27;ve also suggested a weekly email summarising new projects and projects calling for help (see Line 120 or so)<br><br><strong><u>Create and Manage Learning Projects love &quot;projects&quot;!</u></strong><br><br><strong><em>Project Information</em></strong><br><br><strong>Project Name: *</strong><br><br><strong>Short description: *</strong><br>Think of this as a tweet inviting people to participate in the project.

It&#x27;s best framed as a question or challenge!&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project Image:</strong><br>Upload an image to be displayed on your project home page, elsewhere on the P2PU site and promotional materials.<br><br><strong>Project Status:&nbsp; (NEW)</strong><br>What&#x27;s the current status of your project idea?

This should give an indication of the work load&nbsp; and commitment required in the project - and the types of things users will be doing. Don&#x27;t make it too easy - but don&#x27;t make it too hard either.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><em>Project Structure</em></strong><br><br><strong>Project Dates *</strong><br>Each standard course cycle runs over a set time period, as indicated by the default &quot;From date&quot; and &quot;To date&quot; values.

If participants wish to have an alternative meeting time they are encouraged to organise this themselves.<br><br><em>[Process: Meetings need to be scheduled so that the primary organiser meets first. We need to provide resources and help about how to take notes and report backs in project meetings - these outcomes should be the primary archive element for live meetings and also act as a guide for participants scheduling alternative meeting times]</em><br><em>[Ideal:This meeting time should export an ics reminder and be added to a project calendar]</em><br><em>[Ideal:There should be multiple meeting times that can be created for a project]</em><br><br><strong>Project Places:</strong><br><em>Formerly No of Seats</em><br>How many people would you like to have participating in the project?

Are they experts? Risk Takers? Mathematicians? People with short attention spans who need buddies helping them to study?<br><br><strong>[Primary organiser&#x27;s] Goal For The Project:</strong><br>A little bit about your background&#x2F;motives &#x2F; goals for this project.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Add Co-organisers:</strong><br><em>Text entry&nbsp; to select co-organisers by username (should auto-suggest user names)</em><br><em>[Each co-organiser is set as admin and has a &quot;Goal for the Project&quot; field added to the course management page]</em><br><br><br><br><strong>[Things to get rid of] </strong>-<br>&nbsp;About the Course Organiser -&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;This is redundant information that should be drawn from the existing P2PU profile information<br>&nbsp;agreed<br>&nbsp; the original user profile[s] should be embedded &#x2F; linked to from&nbsp; on the course page.

Weekly we can send out a summary of new courses that have been created and also provide updates for the community about what is going on &#x2F; where help is required.<br><br>Eg<br><br><strong><u>New Projects This Week:</u></strong><br><strong>Surf Board Engineering and Design </strong>- Want to shape your own surf board?
