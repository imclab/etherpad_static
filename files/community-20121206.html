The only ones?</li><li>How do we feel accomplished or successful?&nbsp; Are we telling success stories?</li><li>What is our content strategy for engaging our audience.</li><li>Has our idea of what&#x2F;who our audience is, changed?</li><li>Are we still doing what we want&#x2F;love&#x2F;are excited about doing? If so, how do we keep it working, and if not, what needs to change?&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Blogging strategy<ul class="bullet"><li>Suggested content strategy: start with a blank calendar and fill it in with your ideas: this is interested-driven, project-based, opt-in</li><li>Blog Party: Idea nicked from Katie Del Angel at Confab last June: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;slideshare&#x2e;net&#x2F;ISITEDesign&#x2F;confab&#x2d;lightning&#x2d;talk&#x2d;the&#x2d;first&#x2d;100&#x2d;days">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;ISITEDesign&#x2F;confab-lightning-talk-the-first-100-days</a></li><li>Suggestion: Can the blog post titles be posted on the homepage of P2PU?&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>They are- but at the bottom... ah - yes, that should be addressed<ul class="bullet"><li>Like, at the top right or left- and like a *Super* callout box. Sorry to keep cming back to Evernote, but they have their link at the top: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;evernote&#x2e;com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evernote.com&#x2F;</a> which reminds me that they have one when I log in.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>They used to be - perhaps the feed is broken?&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Blogging - so far VMG is the only one who blogs. I&#x27;m going to start harassing people...[BK]<ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp should cross post to info.p2pu.org--he only posts to sharingnicely (Will do!)</li><li>Maybe set the next call to be a content strategy party? We set up a calendar, and people fill in when they are going to post with what topic?<ul class="bullet"><li>That would be great, although I am very aware of not wanting to force people to create bumph</li><li>Dunno BK--I think part of our description was &quot;love your job and show it&quot;? Maybe blog posts are part and parcel of that req?</li><li>Totally. But it should have value</li><li>VMG: taking a wider view is actually less nudgy than requiring a post every week, and speaks more to deciding what kind of information we want to feed out when</li><li>PS: Projects should have communication strategies associated with them, and this is different to &quot;what&#x27;s happening&quot; type messages</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Next steps:<ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp to start posting on info.p2pu.org</li><li>Dirk will write a blog post about the Google meeting</li><li>Chris is already writing two posts - Music Hackday, MOOControler</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Should we use Google Hangouts for community calls?<ul class="bullet"><li>Pros:<ul class="bullet"><li>Feel more engaging</li><li>We can record the meetings to YouTube (maybe this is a negative :) No, this is a plus for anyone who missed it.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Cons:<ul class="bullet"><li>Need G+ account (unless just watching HangOut on Air)</li><li>Bandwidth?</li><li>Leah sits in an ugly office in the basement in a cubicle, typical of most IT folks in most organizations. =Some folks might feel uncomfortable in that scenario where a call can be just on the phone.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>School of Open Badges&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Leah needs more feedback: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;leahmacvie&#x2e;com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;open&#x2d;badges&#x2d;graphic&#x2d;redesign&#x2d;attempt&#x2d;2&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leahmacvie.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;open-badges-graphic-redesign-attempt-2&#x2F;</a>&nbsp;</li><li>This was done using the feedback that I got from the community last week.&nbsp;</li><li>Based on the feedback, I&#x27;ve tried to make it more &quot;serious&quot; and Peter will be helping on the programmer side, and has made comments on the font etc, so there is a reupdate as well - all feedback is welcome!</li><li>Will be jumping onto the beta site towards the end of the week, and experimenting with that</li><li>And have used a &quot;serious&quot; flower!</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br><br></body>
