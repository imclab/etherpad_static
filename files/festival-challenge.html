that just feels stupid to me.<br>so i won&#x27;t be doing the &quot;writing by hand&quot; challenge.<br><br>The &quot;html hunting in the world around you&quot; one was<strong> great fun.</strong><br>but I didn&#x27;t get the badge-system: when I checked the checkboxes myself<br>and got awarded two badges I thought i was done and was dissapointed.<br>I would NEVER have clicked on the peer-reviewed badge - the badges just<br>don&#x27;t look &quot;clickable&quot;. maybe you could but a button below the badge saying<br>&quot;apply for this badge&quot;<br><br>Overall:&nbsp; to start this very basic html-challenges you already have<br>to be very smart with your computer + a digital camera. which is probably ok<br>for 16year olds with an iphone, but you should also offer something for&nbsp;<br>computer-beginners.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>feedback:<br>hard to find the &quot;challenge discussion page&quot; we were directed to in the challenge<br>would have liked additional visual signposts besides the link to start the challenge<br><br><br>Feedback round notes<br><br>1. Aimed at a young audience, not particularly challenging. Maybe because I have a bit more experience in HTML. I kind of feel like the first page with the basic markup (Challenge #2 should have more explanation, what does each element mean). Remove some unnecssary elements for beginners. It would be nice to have a compilation of the code, a final product that you can try out.<br><br>2. Would like to see more happening on the machine, less about writing and drawing. Would prefer to wok in a group, wouldn&#x27;t have done this on my own. Should be a bit more involving.<br><br>3. Some of the tasks are really general, it would be good to provide several examples of how to do the challeneges. It was easy to ask for help since we are in the same place, don&#x27;t know how I would get help through the site.<br><br>4. I need more information about the meaning of the things that I&#x27;m learning, but not strictly drilling. More CSS, more technical.&nbsp;<br><br>5. Love the fact that it&#x27;s simple, hands on, practical but I think that memorizing is not that useful. I just want to plug and play and see it working.<br><br>6.&nbsp; I like that we are encouraged to repeat over and over agian. The first time I did it I didn&#x27;t really understand, the more I copied the more that I learned about the pattern of copying.<br><br>7. Good introduction, I would like the site to give me some more infrastructure, I don&#x27;t want to make a blog.&nbsp;<br><br>8. I didn&#x27;t do the first challenge, I hate copying things. I usually teach people to start just with the body of the document. I really liked the second challenge beacuse it was fun I like that I connected something abstract to something real (marking up the world around you). I don&#x27;t think it was simple to write on the photo itself.&nbsp;<br><br>9. Assumes a lot of knowledge, please specify what I need to know before I start. Not interested in drilling or memorizing. Loved the photo thing, was an inventive way of thinking about the meaning of tags. Learn how to make a hyperlink, I we glossed over that. Interactivity is very motivating. Maybe include pointers to external resources. Emphasze folder and file structure, people don&#x27;t usually know that when they start. If you&#x27;ve got a bunch of people, they can see each others sites by linking to each other. Create some kind of collection on the site.<br><br>10. I&#x27;d prefer to try and learn than to do something, give me an example that I can manipulate. I didn&#x27;t know that I was supposed to click on the task link, so I started to write my own HTML. Really loved the idea of the second challenge. Include some example images on that task that they could mark up.<br><br><br><strong>Challenge ideas</strong><br><br>Group 1<br>a. users are given tags with how to use them and an associated mission (ex &lt;ol&gt; make a list)<br>b. given a base set of HTML code with CSS etc and task the participant with removing as much as possible before breaking the page. purpose to show that broken code can still work.<br>c.
