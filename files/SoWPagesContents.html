How do I do that?</strong><br>You&nbsp; can propose a School of Webcraft course through our course proposal&nbsp; form here. You can also have a look at P2PU&#x27;s &quot;Course Design Handbook&quot;&nbsp; for tips and guidlines on designing your course.<br><br><strong>I&#x27;d like to suggest a course idea, but not necessarily organise it myself. Can I do that?</strong><br>Sure! Create a profile on P2PU&#x27;s site and use the tags feature to share what you want to learn. When a course matching your tags is created, we&#x27;ll let you know.<br><br><strong>I&#x27;ve got something simple I want to learn. Can I still participate?</strong><br>Totally!&nbsp; We&#x27;re happy for you to create a group made up of as little as one discrete task&nbsp; or to connect&nbsp; some related modules together to create a longer learning project.&nbsp;<br><br>You&nbsp; may want to take responsibility for organising only the first focused task and resources and invite other learners to develop tasks for subsequent weeks.<br><br><strong>Do I need to be an expert to start a study group?</strong><br>You&nbsp; don&#x27;t need to be a&nbsp; expert on your topic, but it helps to have some background knowledge and research you begin your group.&nbsp;<br>Study groups are the best way to manage learning a topic you&#x27;re unfamiliar with as together with your peers you can collaboratively explore the learning material.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>While it&nbsp; certainly helps to have some background knowledge about the course or group you&nbsp; organise, the most important thing is to be committed to sharing your&nbsp; learning experience with other passionate people.<br><br><strong>How much of a time commitment is typically involved in running a course or study group?</strong><br>Leading&nbsp; a School of Webcraft course may require three hours a&nbsp; week, over six to ten weeks. A lot of the day-to-day time commitment&nbsp; stems from answering messages from participants and moderating&nbsp; discussions.&nbsp;<br>Course organisers should set aside&nbsp; time before they open the group publicly in order to design their course, create the core tasks, structure the&nbsp; schedule, gather resources and gather feedback from the community.<br><br><br><strong>I&#x27;d like to teach or learn in a language other than English. How can I do that?</strong><br><br>The&nbsp; School of Webcraft is dedicated to providing courses in as many&nbsp; languages as possible. You can see a drop down of available languages on the top left of the P2PU site.&nbsp;<br>We&#x27;re looking for individuals to help us expand&nbsp; School of Webcraft and P2PU into other language communities. To find out&nbsp; more about assisting in localisation please visit these pages.<br><br><strong>I&#x27;d love to get involved but I&#x27;ve got limited time. Can I set my own schedule?</strong><br><br>That&#x27;s&nbsp; no problem, participants can organise a project whenever is convenient&nbsp; for them, so you&#x27;re welcome to create a project idea and set the start&nbsp; and end dates to suit your schedule.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you offer accreditation for School of Webcraft courses? Like a diploma or certificate?</strong><br><br>Not&nbsp; yet. But we are developing an accreditation system based on badges. The&nbsp; Open Badge framework will help learners publicise their achievement and&nbsp; skills to outside stakeholders, like potential employers.<br>Learn more about the Open Badges project.<br><br><strong>I have a question that&#x27;s not covered here. How can I get in touch with someone about it?</strong><br>The best way to find something out is to ask in our question and answer forum. <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;qa&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qa.p2pu.org&#x2F;</a><br><br><br></body>
