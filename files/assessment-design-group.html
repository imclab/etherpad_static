For example, collaboration is a crucial skill for success in the global workplace, but is hard to assess with a paper and pencil, or fill-in-the-bubble test; and while used as a teaching method in formal education from time to time, is rarely assessed in a way that would provide informative feedback to the learner about how to improve in this dimension.</li><li>Review <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;educause&#x2e;edu&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;Browse&#x2F;Deeper&#x25;20Learning&#x2F;31407">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.educause.edu&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;Browse&#x2F;Deeper%20Learning&#x2F;31407</a></li><li>See: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;eschoolnews&#x2e;com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;alliance&#x2d;calls&#x2d;for&#x2d;deeper&#x2d;learning&#x2d;to&#x2d;better&#x2d;prepare&#x2d;students&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eschoolnews.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;alliance-calls-for-deeper-learning-to-better-prepare-students&#x2F;</a></li><li>See: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;learningandteaching&#x2e;info&#x2F;learning&#x2F;deepsurf&#x2e;htm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learningandteaching.info&#x2F;learning&#x2F;deepsurf.htm</a></li><li>See: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;engsc&#x2e;ac&#x2e;uk&#x2F;learning&#x2d;and&#x2d;teaching&#x2d;theory&#x2d;guide&#x2F;deep&#x2d;and&#x2d;surface&#x2d;approaches&#x2d;learning">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engsc.ac.uk&#x2F;learning-and-teaching-theory-guide&#x2F;deep-and-surface-approaches-learning</a></li><li>See: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;west&#x2e;asu&#x2e;edu&#x2F;nlii&#x2F;learning&#x2e;htm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.west.asu.edu&#x2F;nlii&#x2F;learning.htm</a></li><li>See: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;west&#x2e;asu&#x2e;edu&#x2F;nlii&#x2F;learningtable&#x2e;htm&#x23;ownership">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.west.asu.edu&#x2F;nlii&#x2F;learningtable.htm#ownership</a></li><li>Deeper learning items on most current lists of &quot;21st Century Knowledge and Skills&quot; share some characteristics that make them hard to measure with large-scale standarized bubble tests. They are complex, they are often entailed and envoked in real-world settings, and they manefest themselves as events rather than objects. By complex we mean that they are called for in situations with uncertainties, with overlapping simultaneous causal factors, and with nonlinear highly networked relationships. By events we mean &quot;knowledge-in-action&quot;&nbsp;</li><li>One way to explore the conditions that promote deeper learning is to ask two questions of each skill 1) what does someone do when they are demonstrating x,y,z (this is the &quot;student model&quot; of the skill-in-action) and 2) what situations are they in when demonstrating x,y,z (this is the &quot;task model&quot; that provides an opportunity to perform the skill-in-action). For example, what does someone do who is proficient in critical thinking and solving complex problems? He and she...<ul class="bullet"><li>take several perspectives on the problem or situation and examine the problem for several sides, taking note of the benefits and limitations of each point of view</li><li>create multiple potential solutions, then test those ideas against criteria developed to judge the worthiness of a good solution</li><li>compare and contrast among options</li><li>argue for one position and then argue against it</li><li>build a model and test its limits for representing the problem and offering solution avenues</li><li>seeks outside opinions and critique</li><li>and so forth</li></ul></li><li>Then, what kinds of situations give rise to these sorts of behaviors<ul class="bullet"><li>when a problem has more than one right answer [eg. a design-type problem]</li><li>when there are many conflicting potential outcomes of a problem and its solution</li><li>when there are many unknowns</li><li>etc.</li></ul></li><li>Deeper learning is involved under circumstances like these because settling upon a solution requires going beneath the surface features of the problem to grapple with underlying more nuanced decision-points and consequences (e.g. &quot;building a bridge that will wipe out a low-income neighborhood&quot;).</li><li>The measurement problem for these kinds of learning environments is how to sample the space of the student model, task model and build a defensible inference from the evidence. Its no wonder that large scale assessments have not been able to solve this kind of problem; but things are about to change.</li><li>See: SMARTER balanced assessment Consortium <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;k12&#x2e;wa&#x2e;us&#x2F;smarter&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.k12.wa.us&#x2F;smarter&#x2F;</a></li><li>See: Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;parcconline&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;parcconline.org&#x2F;</a></li></ul></li></ul><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>b) brief discussion of other frameworks and how ours fits (what we are borrowing, what we are redefining) - what does open, social, collaborative learning mean<ul class="bullet"><li>Is the idea here to compare learning environments, assessment and recognition systems...?</li></ul></li><li>c) fit this back to the deeper learning, relationship btwn open collab learning and deeper learning<ul class="bullet"><li>what do we do better with online learning? personalization, timeliness, linking to networked resources, locus of control (self-direction). Open collaborative learning is a context that could readily meet some of the criteria of the task model (above). If the workspace is such that it captures the work history of a _group_ of learners actually _collaborating_ to&nbsp; solve a complex problem they almost certainly will leave a trace of actions that could be understood as critical thinking e.g., evidence of the &quot;student model.&quot; In addition to examining process, the task could be designed to have some real-world evidence on completion, eg, a product that can be examined and tested by an audience online.</li><li>assessment, motivation, etc.&nbsp; Perhaps &quot;crowd-sourcing&quot; of the assessment.

So any kind of symbol of such&nbsp; an&nbsp; assessment (such as a badge that represents what someone knows or&nbsp; can&nbsp; do) needs to emerge from an intersection of these three&nbsp; opportunities.</li><li>New&nbsp; assessment mechanisms and&nbsp; processes are arising to capture deeper&nbsp; learning, including technolgy&nbsp; enabled mechanisms that include peer&nbsp; assessment, automated&nbsp; documentation, interactive tutoring and feedback,&nbsp; and the social&nbsp; construction of signs and symbols of the meaning and&nbsp; value of complex&nbsp; knowledge and skills, including deeper learning&nbsp; outcomes that are best&nbsp; understood over time. Each of these methods&nbsp; offers new possibilities for&nbsp; promoting and validating deeper learning,&nbsp; but at the same time, need to&nbsp; be critically examined for their benefits&nbsp; and challenges to existing&nbsp; professional practices.</li></ul></li><li>d) foundation for the implementation<ul class="bullet"><li>from concepts to measures</li></ul></li><li>e) meta-assessment, how do you evaluate it?<ul class="bullet"><li>how do you measure the measures</li></ul></li></ul><br>where do badges fit in? might be its own system<br>need to have a name for ours<br><br>2 groups granted millions from the government to rethink assessments (for K12):<br>mimi&#x27;s connected learning group is connected<br>can we hook into these guys? at least good to mention in the document&nbsp;<br>1) SMARTER balanced assessment<br>2) Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC<br>TASK: everyone reach out to their network to get more info on these guys<br><br><strong>PROCESS</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Google doc - Alex will start</li><li>Regular weekly calls - Wednesdays 1PM (skype)to</li><li>Separate call for SoW&#x2F;assessment foundation</li><li>Need to work on the definition of what the content person is building - designed experience (template)<ul class="bullet"><li>moving P2PU from the course model to the quest or task model so how we define the task&#x2F;quest is really crucial (stand up to the framework but also as simple as possible)</li></ul></li></ul><br>POST-it Notes from Badges Mtg II (July 18-19)<br>Post-it notes were grouped by the participants into groupings, two of those groups are reproduced here as they may shed light on design questions or framework ideas.<br>Nils Peterson editoral comments while posting these notes in [ ]<br><br>BADGES FOR LEARNING<br><ul class="bullet"><li>How to learn from mistakes of educatational games.
