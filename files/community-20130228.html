Each group would also comment on the&nbsp; other group&#8217;s answers. I&#x27;m not sure the current platform has a way of easily splitting people up into groups. Is there a hack around this?<ul class="bullet"><li>Answer: Ask people to collaborate by email or in a space they like to use (skype, hangouts, google docs) and then one person can post the result. Do Social hacking versus tech hacking. Ask people whatever tool they are comfortable with.</li><li>Also could create a different page for each group on P2PU platform = one hack. and have comments happen.

Would try to cut out some questions (there will be an overload of information). And consider using a google form, which handles questionnaires more elegantly. Although it is nice to ask people to post in the discussion forum, because then everyone can see the other answers, and it helps with community building&#x2F; introductions. Maybe use one or two questions that way, and move the rest into a google form.
