Introductory Questions:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>When have you been a mentor?<ul class="bullet"><li>Tutoring immigrant schoolchildren</li><li>Helping township youth into a career in food</li><li>Currently mentoring someone learning to code</li><li>I&#x27;ve been a teacher, which i suspect is very similar</li><li>in past work situations</li><li>Nephew</li><li>Some past jobs with programming instruction</li><li>music instruction to friends</li><li>What are mentors getting out of it?</li><li>Grooming the next generation (esp. in academia)<ul class="bullet"><li>Paying it forward</li><li>Mentors choose to give up their time, so there needs to be an initial opt-in and rapport, which can&#x27;t be manufactured</li><li>If it goes well, there is a real sense of shared success</li><li>Coffee from Bekka</li><li>Generally, you get to work with people who *want* to learn (in most mentorship relationship you choose to be a mentor)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>When have you been a mentee?<ul class="bullet"><li>All my tertiary educational career</li><li>All the time</li><li>Throughout the P2PU experience, esp. starting up<ul class="bullet"><li>I&#x27;m pretty good at it now, but feel I could have done more to find and work with mentors earlier in my life</li></ul></li><li>Not formally (me neither, what does formally mean?<ul class="bullet"><li>understanding that it&#x27;s a mentor relationship and actively making time for it</li><li>is learning from someone being a mentee?</li><li>wait, currently, Paul Osman is mentoring me :) (Isn&#x27;t he mentoring us all!)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br>II. Mentorship<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Good Work<ul class="bullet"><li>Ethical</li><li>Engaging</li><li>Excellent</li></ul></li><li>When &quot;good work&quot; is accomplished all of these dimensions are aligned<ul class="bullet"><li>For example: nursing (aims of the nurse and the patients are aligned -&gt; get better)</li><li>Anti-example: US congress at the moment, goals not aligned</li></ul></li><li>How are the norms and practices of a community of practice (=fields) passed on to new joiners?<ul class="bullet"><li>Studied three generations of workers in a number of fields</li><li>Found that mentors played an important role in helping them into the community&#x2F;field<ul class="bullet"><li>Set ethical standards</li><li>Engage and create interests&#x2F;passion&nbsp;</li><li>Challenge to push beyond pesonal goals towards excellence</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>It&#x27;s how to be an actor in a particular field, habits and norms, rather than just content knowledge</li><li>This works well in established fields</li><li>What about emerging, new fields, like most of our jobs? Geneticists (grounded in other communities)<ul class="bullet"><li>I think there are very strong norms in the tech space</li><li>Each community of practice&#x2F;field comes out of other fields and will retain some of the norms and practices from those fields</li></ul></li></ul><br>III. Role of a Mentor<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Purpose</li><li>Results</li></ul><br>IV. Implications for P2PU<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Expectations for Mentors<ul class="bullet"><li>Expertise--knowing the questions that the mentee needs to ask</li><li>Humane-ness</li><li>Sustained relationship</li></ul></li><li>Matchmaking<ul class="bullet"><li>both parties must opt-in</li></ul></li><li>Priorities for mentorship at P2PU<ul class="bullet"><li>Sense of shared success</li><li>Impart confidence--someone who believes in you</li><li>Norms and practices of that field</li><li>Modeling a certain identity</li><li>3 levels of P2PU-style mentorship<ul class="bullet"><li>Staff, people who work on P2PU helping each other get their heads around stuff)</li><li>Community of course organisers - people who run courses now, how do they get help from people who have done it before.</li><li>Mentorship around communities of learning&nbsp; - in schools, or the mechanical MOOC</li></ul></li><li>How do we handle expertise in our community of learning? People want to learn from others who know more than them, but in a flat community of learning, how does this work?<ul class="bullet"><li>One option is to think about inviting teams in to evaluate an aspect of the learning process and try to cultivate mentorship relationships out of that.&nbsp;</li><li>PS: people assume that in peer-to-peer learning everyone is equal. This isn&#x27;t necessarily the case, but we want to ensure that there is not any kind of unequal power relationship</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br>Evolving, where both mentor and mentee adjust expecations, and the way they collaborate (incl. to decide that the need for mentorship was addressed)<br><br><br></body>
