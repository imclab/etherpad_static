This includes:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>support creation of badge challenges</li><li>promote&#x2F;display badges, badge challenges, and awarded badges within the P2PU platform.</li><li>allow users to send the badges they earn to the Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI) -- done for osqa pilot badges, needs to be extended for sending lernanta badges</li><li>track and report metrics</li></ul><br><strong><u>Core Features&#x2F;Functionality:</u></strong><br><br><strong>ROLES</strong><br><br><strong>(1) Badge Admins (new role on p2pu)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>To allow schools and p2pu to endorse awarded badges some or all the&nbsp; initial&nbsp; badge challenges will be created by people appointed by the&nbsp; schools.</li><li>We will allow school organizers to select badge challenge creators for the schools.</li><li>These people will need the necessary UI to create and manage challenges and the badges associated with them.</li><li>Creating a badge challenge includes selection and customization of the assesment logic and the badge that will be awarded.</li><li>Badge challenges created by&nbsp; badge admins of a school will be associated to the school as well as the&nbsp; corresponding badges and the badge challenge will display information&nbsp; about which school endorse them).</li></ul><br><strong>(2) Study Groups&#x2F;Course Organizers (existing role)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Depending on the assesment logic behing them, some badge challenges or all of&nbsp; them will require the interaction between users (e.g. user submits some&nbsp; piece of work for review as proof that (s)he deserves the badge, and&nbsp;&nbsp; someone has to review it).<ul class="bullet"><li>One of the options to allow users to interact with eachother is to allow this interaction to occur inside a study group or course.<ul class="bullet"><li>In order to bring badge challenges into the courses, organizers (maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; participant too if it&nbsp; is not a course but a study group) will select&nbsp; badge challenges&nbsp; endorsed by their schoolto be displayed as tasks inside their&nbsp; study groups or courses.</li><li>The developer(s) implementing&nbsp; the functionality for integrating badges into&nbsp; lernanta will make the desicion of how much of the necessary logic&nbsp; will&nbsp; be implemented for&nbsp; all tasks and which part only for the badge challenges.<ul class="bullet"><li>As a first step implement what we find easier given how tasks are implemented at the moment and the refactoring plans to provide pages for schools.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>John: Will this interaction also occur in the UI for mentoring? Will this interaction occur at the challenge page (i.e. no restrictions in who intereact with who)?</li></ul></li><li>It is possible that the Web&nbsp; Making 101 course will&nbsp; require a few badges not endorsed by the school, to give&nbsp; a sense of&nbsp; completion to other&nbsp;&nbsp; tasks of their course, or to the actual&nbsp; course.<ul class="bullet"><li>If this happens then&nbsp; there will be badge challenges and badges not created by badge admins&nbsp; and associated to specific groups or courses.</li><li>John: Will this be neccesary or not?</li></ul></li><li>After asking John we will get a better idea, but from what we know at the moment the first priority here is to allow selecting endorsed badges to be part of the task list of a group or study group.</li></ul><br><strong>(3) Study Group&#x2F;Course Participants (or users that want to get a badge)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will be awarded to them automatically (based on metrics tracked in p2pu).</li><li>Others will require users to submit pieces of work to a badge challenge, and review eachother work. Kind of what happens currently with comments in&nbsp; a&nbsp; task but now with the clear objective of awarding a badge.</li></ul><br><strong>ASSESSMENTS LOGIC</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Stealth assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>On the first badge pilot we did&nbsp; not add badges that were awarded based on stealth assessment but the&nbsp; software that we customized for the pilot&nbsp; had&nbsp; badges like these to&nbsp; encourage certain behaivours among their&nbsp; users (e.g. <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;badges&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;badges&#x2F;23&#x2F;pundit&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;badges.p2pu.org&#x2F;badges&#x2F;23&#x2F;pundit)</a>.</li><li>This kind of assessment logic will allow us to automatically award badges based on metrics collected inside p2pu</li><li>We have to see how much customization we can put into them (i.e. if we&nbsp;&nbsp; can&#x2F;want rely to a certain degree on superusers, badge admins and group organizers for their customization and&#x2F;creation) but as a first step&nbsp; we&nbsp; can define them at the source code level and let those creating the&nbsp; badge challenge to choose from the list of stealth assesments we&nbsp; provide.</li><li>The initial stealth assesments available will be based on the metrics we are&nbsp; collecting already collecting and we will have to start collecting data specifically releated to the user behaviour around badge challenges.</li><li>examples of things we could give recognition for with stealth assesments are:&nbsp;&nbsp; visited course pages X numbers of days in a week, posted X numbers of&nbsp;&nbsp; comments, reviewed X numbers of submitions.</li><li>John: Which has more priority for WebMaking 101: stealth assesments or peer assessment?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Peer assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>This kind of assessment logic will allow users to get recognision from their peers</li><li>The&nbsp;&nbsp; first badge pilot showed&nbsp; that up&#x2F;down votes were not appropiate&nbsp; because&nbsp; down votes are&nbsp; unlikelly to occur (thus the idea of rating the&nbsp; submited&nbsp; work) and&nbsp; that we need to make it simple for peers to evaluate&nbsp; each&nbsp; other work&nbsp; (thus the idea of providing rubrics with the badge&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges).</li><li>In&nbsp;&nbsp; some cases it will allow users to submit their work for review (e.g.&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive recognition when they learned something) and in others&nbsp; users&nbsp; will nominate their peers directly (e.g. to give recognition to&nbsp; their&nbsp; peers for qualities like good team player)<ul class="bullet"><li>John: Do we need the second case for WebMaking 101?</li><li>Both cases have the roles of &quot;candidate for earning a badge&quot;, and &quot;peer evaluating if the candidate should earn the badge&quot;</li><li>The logic behind them will vary (i.e. be customizable by badge admins) depending on:<ul class="bullet"><li>the&nbsp; scale defined for votes and and threadholds of votes and number of&nbsp;&nbsp; peers evaluations to issue the badge (e.g. we can have peers evaluate&nbsp;&nbsp; from a scale from 1 to five and require a 3 or higher rating from 3&nbsp;&nbsp; assessors to issue the badge)</li><li>if a rubric consisting of yes or no questions (checkboxs) is provided to help&#x2F;automate a bit how rating is given.</li><li>if a submition is necessary from the candidate that will earn the badge</li><li>what will be evidence that will be associated to the awarded badge once the challenge is completed by a user.</li><li>if it has to check that the candidate already have some prerequisit badges.</li><li>John: which of this if not all are necessary for WebMaking 101?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>John: please priorize the different configuration options for this kind of assessment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Guru assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will require us to be more restrictive with repect to who can evaluate a canditate (i.e. trigger a badge award).<ul class="bullet"><li>John: is that the case for WebMaking 101 badges?</li></ul></li><li>This restriction will take place either by requiring that people evaluating&nbsp;&nbsp; to already have those badges or that they have some role (course&nbsp;&nbsp; organizers, badge admins, maybe mentors).</li><li>In other matters this kind of assesment will work like the peer assessment.</li><li>in&nbsp; the case that we require users to have the badge in order to rate others the&nbsp; initial seeds will be provided through honorary assessment (see below).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Honorary assessment:</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>For&nbsp;&nbsp; seeding purposes (so guru assessment can start), we will need a way to issue a badge to someone&nbsp;&nbsp; directly even if they have not completed a challenge (see guru&nbsp;&nbsp; assessment for the reason we need this)</li><li>Badge&nbsp;&nbsp; admins will be able to do this and the evidense will include who&nbsp;&nbsp; awarded them the badge and why (text filled out by the badge admin).</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>BADGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>For badges we need the information that will go into the OBI (name, short&nbsp;&nbsp; description, image) and a little more (long description) to display in&nbsp;&nbsp; the badge page which url will go to the OBI when a badge is awarded.</li></ul><br><strong>BADGE CHALLENGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Creating a badge challenge will include:<ul class="bullet"><li>Filling out a title and description.</li><li>Selecting and configuring the assessment logic.</li><li>Chossing the badge that will be awarded to those completing the challenge.</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>WORK SUBMISSIONS</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Some badges will require candidates to submit a piece of work for review.</li><li>Submissions will use rich text (meaning users can embed things like github gists, ... as part of their submition and upload files).</li><li>we&nbsp; need versioning (like we have on tasks) for submissions because users&nbsp;&nbsp; can go back to improve their work (don&#x27;t think we need to reset the&nbsp;&nbsp; votes after the user posts a new version if it is clear on the evidence page which votes correspond to each version).<ul class="bullet"><li>if a peer votes again in a different version the old vote will be override in the count but still appear on the evidence</li></ul></li><li>users should be able to &quot;delete&quot; a work submition (and restore it). data&nbsp; will&nbsp; remain on the database but it will not be displayed. -- the # of deleted submissions and versions can be included as a metric too.<ul class="bullet"><li>A message saying this submission was deleted will appear on the evidence page in case the user already sent the badge to the OBI</li><li>If the user has not send the badge to the OBI the badges earned for this submition will not be displayed or sent to the OBI</li><li>If the user have not earned the badge the submission will not be visible for review and thus the badge will not be awarded.</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>AWARDED BADGES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>It&#x27;s was goes into the OBI.<ul class="bullet"><li>data from the badge (name, short description)</li><li>the badge challenge (url that points to the page with information about the criteria for awarding the badge) -- at the moment called &#x27;template&#x27; on django-obi</li><li>evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; (url to a page that has the evidence of how the badge was awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; depending on the badge challenge and the assessment logic this will&nbsp; vary&nbsp; but as and example it could have all the submissions from the user&nbsp; and&nbsp; the ratings + feedback (s)he got)</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>WALL ACTIVITIES</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Activity&nbsp;&nbsp; around badges will be on the existing &#x27;Default&#x27;, &#x27;Learning&#x27;, and &#x27;All&#x27;&nbsp;&nbsp; filters of the walls (groups&#x2F;courses, dashboard, profiles)</li><li>A new filter will be included just for activity related to Badges (named &#x27;Badges&#x27;).</li><li>How the deletion of walls mentioned on <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;webcraft&#x2d;ux">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;webcraft-ux</a> affects this</li></ul><br><strong>BADGE CHALLENGE ENDORSMENT</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>As&nbsp;&nbsp;

basic assessment and badge functionality into Lernanta for the School&nbsp; of Webcraft 0.1 project. These assessments and badges will be focused&nbsp; within the Webmaking 101 course and aligned with tasks. Below represents&nbsp; the core features required to run a pilot within the Webmaking 101&nbsp; course.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Goals:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>support badge challenges and learner submissions</li><li>support peer assessment</li><li>support guru assessment</li><li>support&nbsp; stealth assessment (if any, will have minimal stealth assessment in&nbsp; this round, tied to metrics like site visits, number of assessments,&nbsp; etc.</li><li>push badges into the Open Badge Infrastructure</li><li>promote&#x2F;display badges within the P2PU platform</li><li>track and report metrics</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>Core Features&#x2F;Functionality:</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>ADMINISTRATION</strong><br><strong>(1) Badge Admin role</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>New role in the system that gives people permissions to create and administer badges and a backend interface to do so</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(2) Create Master Tasks</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Create tasks that include assessments and badges that are then available to pull into a course.</li><li>This interface to create Master Tasks is only available to Badge Admins</li><li>Includes creation of assessment and option of creating the badge or linking to existing badge</li><li>Assessment creation form would include:<ul class="bullet"><li>Assessment Title</li><li>Assessment Type (peer, guru or stealth)</li><li>Rubric assessment? yes&#x2F;no</li><li>Assessment Instructions&#x2F;Description</li><li>Additional Details</li><li>Badge&nbsp; Alignment (pick from a list) - pick from the list of available system&nbsp; badges OR Create and link a badge (linking to the form outlined below)</li></ul></li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(3) Create badges</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Create custom badges that will be available to choose from when creating a task</li><li>This interface to create badges outside of a course is only available to Badge Admins</li><li>Badge creation form should be similar to the creation form on OSQA, including:<ul class="bullet"><li>Badge title</li><li>Short Description</li><li>Long Description</li><li>Prerequisite badges (choose from existing badges)</li><li>Is this a peer-to-peer badge?<ul class="bullet"><li>If No:<ul class="bullet"><li>Badge Logic:<ul class="bullet"><li>Has-the-badge&nbsp; Required? - is the voting restricted to only those who have earned the&nbsp; badge (plus anyone we designate as an owner below)</li><li>Votes: Number Badge positive ratings required&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>NOTE:&nbsp; Since we are moving to ranges, we need to think about how this&nbsp; translates into the master settings.

For stealth assessment, we could identify several metrics that&nbsp; we track and award badges for like, checked into site 5 times a week,&nbsp; participated in course discussion &gt;x times, etc. I can think through a&nbsp; few of these for the initial pass, just might take me a little more&nbsp; time)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Type of badge (skill, value, peer, participation, misc.)</li><li>Owner&nbsp; of the badge (optional) - this allows us to give only certain people&nbsp; the ability to vote on&nbsp; submissions for specific badges. This should not&nbsp; be a full list of all users in OSQA, but instead a list of roles:&nbsp; (check all that apply) Course Organizer (of the course the badge is used&nbsp; in), Course Admins, Badge Admins</li><li>Expiration date? (not required for pilot)&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>If Yes: calendar to pick date</li></ul></li><li>Badge image file</li></ul></li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(4) Issue a badge to a user from administration</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>For seeding purposes, we will need a way to issue a badge to someone directly without the formal assessment channels.</li><li>From&nbsp; Badge Admin interface, could have a button&#x2F;link to issue the badge&nbsp; which brings up a set of fields to enter the username and a&nbsp; justification of why they deserve the badge</li><li>The badge should then link back to that justification&#x2F;endorsement</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(5) Restrict voting on certain badges to specific roles or those who have the badge</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>See&nbsp; above. Work&#x2F;submissions for expert level badges and some miscellaneous&nbsp; badges can only be assessed by certain experts or people who have&nbsp; already earned the badge.</li><li>This is specified in the badge creation form</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(6) View metrics</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who can see these metrics? the admins<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Can come up with the list but # submissions, # assessments, average rating on assessments, # badges issued, etc.</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>TASK CREATION FROM COURSE</strong><br><strong>(1) Pull a Master Task into the course</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Choose from a list of the available Master Tasks to pull into a course<ul class="bullet"><li>What are some examples of &quot;Master Task&quot;?&nbsp; these would be the P2PU-developed, vetted assessments built as master&nbsp; tasks that could then be pulled into the course. Basically, instead of&nbsp; relying on the course designer (content person) to build in the&nbsp; assessments that we have designed, we can just build them and let&nbsp; him&#x2F;her pull them directly in. Also, when we move the assessments&#x2F;badges&nbsp; beyond the web-making 101 course, this would be a way for us to make&nbsp; designed, endorsed assessments that course organizers can pull into&nbsp; courses.</li></ul></li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>(2) Add an assessment to a task (optional)</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>See above, same flow as task creation in the admin interface<ul class="bullet"><li>What&#x27;s the difference between an assessment and a badge? Get a badge by doing the assessment on a task?&nbsp; The badge is the end thing that you get if you are successful at&nbsp; completing the assessment. An assessment might be a series of questions&nbsp; or exercises that you have to submit work for. If reviewers&#x2F;assessors&nbsp; rate the work high enough, you then earn the badge. So the badge is a&nbsp; symbol of mastery of a particular topic, with the evidence being the&nbsp; successfully completed assessment. There may be multiple assessments&nbsp; that lead to one badge - essentially different pathways to that badge.

But I can&nbsp; see how that is difficult for some badges - for example, if you design&nbsp; an interesting &quot;challenge&quot; that is not entirely focused on JS, how do&nbsp; you know it could lead to a JS badge? Is that something we can solve&nbsp; through hand-holding - and reviewing tasks carefully as they are&nbsp; developed. We&#x27;ll have more control as we will be more actively&nbsp; developing the tasks&#x2F;content ourselves.&nbsp;<br>Right,&nbsp; and there will be badges that I think we would want to encourage or try&nbsp; out different assessments for, no?
