From scratch.<br><br><br><br>Jose Flores<br>Title: P2PU API creator<br>If there would be one badge for most active community member who has never been employed by P2PU, it will be hard to pass Jose on volume and amount of work done for p2pu<s> in the near future</s>. <s>The P2PU API you might be using is his work. </s>Chances are good that you are doing one of his courses or using a feature he developed.<br><br><br><br>Karen Gabriels<br>Title: National Treasur(er)<br>Keeps our finances tidy. And our monies safe. And our boss out of jail.&nbsp;<br><br>Vanessa Gennarelli<br>Title: Learning Lead<br>How people learn stuff and in online peer-based structures is one of the greates enigmas of our time. You need one badass researcher who works on the fringe of technology and learning to deliver actionable results. Enter Vanessa, who makes delightful learning experiences with an (over)dose of charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Allen Gunn<br>Title: Facile Landlord<br>Relationships&nbsp; with landlords are rarely easy, but ours is a great exception, Gunner&nbsp; is not our workshop facilitator of choice without reason. He is&nbsp; executive director at Aspiration, helping NGOs, activists, foundations&nbsp; and software developers make more effective use of technology for social&nbsp; change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Stian Haklev<br>Title: Co-founder<br>Recently hailed as one of the &#x27;fantastic 5&#x27; in open education, where he was portrayed as Ben Grimm, Stian has been destroying old institutional structures as a rock solid board member since p2pu&#x27;s inception.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Rebecca Kahn<br>Title: The Dean Mother<br>People generally think that if Bekka were to leave p2pu it would fall apart. We have in the past thought about renaming p2pu to the Kahn Academy but that created too much confusion with other initiatives. Bekka really is the heart and soul of p2pu; any users who are frustrated with the automaton p2pu.org come in and talk to Bekka. She&#x27;ll make you a nice cup of tea.<br><br><br>Alexander Kehayias<br>Title: Founder of the P2PU Mentor Program<br>Alex&nbsp; has been working on a mentorship platform for people to connect with&nbsp; knowledgable mentors to guide them through learning a topic.<br><br>Molly Kleinman<br>Title: Vice president for copyright and microwave oven programming<br>Molly takes time out of her busy snacking schedule to drop copyright education bombs on the academic world.

He is a founding volunteer with the School of Open, but also contributes to P2PU&#x27;s work on mentorship, interface design, the Open Masters project, and pretty much any place people are thinking about the intersections of learning, identity, and information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>Gary Matkin<br>Title: Risk taker<br>Gary&nbsp; is Dean of the Extension School at University of California Irvine. He&nbsp; taught Philipp everything he knows about accounting (in 45 min) and&nbsp; infused P2PU with an awesome &quot;beg for forgiveness, rather than ask for&nbsp; permission&quot; attitude from the start.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><br>Jo&#227;o Menezes<br>Title: Design thinker<br>Jo&#227;o is a user-centered design expert, and the projects he engaged in during his &#x27;UX design&#x27; course have inspired much of the design of the early p2pu.org platform. Jo&#227;o continues his journey at p2pu and aims to help build meaningful interactions among peers through the design thinking phylosophy and tools.&nbsp;<br><br>Dany Javier Bautista Monta&#241;a&nbsp;<br>Title: Founder P2PU ambassador program<br>Disappointed by the lack of easy access to learning about web design in Colombia, Dany gathered a group of people and engaged in learning web design&nbsp; through p2pu, setting up the &quot;p2pu ambassador program&quot; in South America&nbsp; in the process. He currenly leads this &#x27;p2pu ambassador program&#x27; for p2pu.<br><br>Laura Newman<br>Title: Dean of Data<br>In a partnership with OKFN, Laura recently started developing the school of data....<br><br><br><br><br>Paul Osman<br>Title: Fork lover<br>It appears to be so that Paul likes forks, regardless of whether these are pitchforks or software forks. It&#x27;s been great for him that he found his 2 places where he can combine his forking hobbies, his forked Moziila drumbeat.org code is the basis of p2pu as we now know it, and he is currently employed as a developer evangelist at SoundCloud.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Neeru Paharia<br>Title: Co-founder and Board Member<br>As co-founder and original gang-star&nbsp; Neeru didn&#x27;t think it enough to theorise about starting a peer learning&nbsp; platform; she also created and organised the &#x27;Behavioral Economics&#x27;&nbsp; pilot course at p2pu. Neeru has been at the root of P2U&#x27;s success in&nbsp; many ways and now employs her vast experience on the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Jane Park<br>Title: Openness Lead<br>Another founding volunteer who loves p2pu so much she made it her day job -- almost. Jane works for Creative Commons and devotes 60% of her time to co-creating the &#x27;School of Open&#x27; (insert link to <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;schools&#x2F;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open&#x2F;&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;schools&#x2F;school-of-open&#x2F;)</a> with open advocates from around the world.<br><br><br><br>Andrew Rens<br>Title: Founding Volunteer<br>As a founding volunteer and early course facilitator of Copyright for Educators, Andrew was instrumental at arriving to a choice for a specific open license and the legalities involved in implementing the license at p2pu. He was formerly the legal lead for Creative Commons South Africa.<br><br><br>Philipp Schmidt<br>Title: Master of the Custodial Arts<br>Not just a pretty face, Philipp is the executive director of p2pu answering only to the board, the community and Delia, which means everyone. How he still manages to get any work done is a mystery.&nbsp;<s>&nbsp; Working closely with the community, Philipp is at the core of many of&nbsp; the activites deployed at p2pu, keeping in mind core values and&nbsp; facilitating the deployment of recsources to make this stuff happen.</s><br><br>Jessy Kate Schingler<br>title: P2PhDean<br>Jessy is P2PU&#x27;s resident Superwoman--brains, brawn and badassery. Jessy is passionate about the ways that openness and collaboration can advance science and research. At&nbsp; P2PU, she&#x27;s focused on bringing science to our everyday lives, opening&nbsp; up research to be accessible to many, and making moments for reflection.<br><br><br><br>Niels Sprong<br>Title: Game Preparer, Developer, and Player&nbsp;<br>Niels is a man of many talents. He&#x27;ll beat you hands down playing cards,&nbsp; but then he&#x27;ll make you dinner afterwards. A founding volunteer at&nbsp; P2PU, Niels ran courses on Poker and Strategic Thinking and Molecular&nbsp; Gastronomy, and keeps asking us difficult questions, which is why we&nbsp; like to keep him around.&nbsp;<br><br>Aleksander Stachurka<br>Title: Designer<br>In&nbsp;&nbsp; establishing p2pu&#x27;s visual identity, Aleksander has done a great job&nbsp; in&nbsp; translating the ideas of the the community into p2pu&#x27;s visual&nbsp; identity.&nbsp; Aleks now runs his own photography studio in Warsaw, Poland.<br><br>Nadeem Shabir<br>Title: Board Member<br>When&nbsp;&nbsp; Nadeem is not eloquently luring people at p2pu workshops into letting&nbsp;&nbsp; their emotions about peer learning run freely, he uses his vast&nbsp;&nbsp; experience in programming to contribute to the p2pu platform and add a&nbsp;&nbsp; developer perspective to the board.<br><br>Mark Surman<br>Title: Board member, Executive Director Mozilla Foundation<br>Mark&nbsp; loves all things open, including wine bars in San Francisco that are&nbsp; still open at 2am. As Mozilla Foundation ED he is leading an army of&nbsp; webmakers to keep the web open. As board member of P2PU he helps Philipp&nbsp; get more done.&nbsp;<br><br>Joel Thierstein<br>Title: Co-founder and Board Member<br>Possibly&nbsp;&nbsp; the hippest provost in the history of US academia, p2pu co-founder&nbsp; Joel&nbsp; has been upping the cool-level of p2pu since the early days as a&nbsp;&nbsp; co-founder. He currently sits on the board of P2PU and works for Rice&nbsp;&nbsp; University and the US Department of Education as a senoir advisor and&nbsp; counsel.<br><br><br>Dirk Uys<br>Title: Developer<br>While you&#x27;re surfing the web Dirk is probably surfing a crazy wave just off the coast of Durban. He is a software developer stoked to engage with the community and get the stuff the community thinks up implemented on p2pu.org. Any email to Dirk has to start with the words &quot;Shot bru!&quot;<br><br>Chloe Varelidi<br>Title: Head of Games<br>If&nbsp; you would ever say a course is too difficult for you, Chloe would&nbsp; respond with &quot;No, it&#x27;s a challenge :)&quot; Before courses were courses,&nbsp; Chloe designed the basic way in which you can now structure courses into&nbsp; meaningful and challenging chunks, creating a better learning&nbsp; experience for everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>Zuzel Vera<br>Title: Very First Tech Lead<br>Zuzel&nbsp; will probably rank high in any top list of most productive developers&nbsp; ever. P2PU would have been called about:blank if it weren&#x27;t for her.<br><br><br>Alan Webb<br>Title: Journeyman<br>Alan&nbsp; supports those who wish to move passionately in the direction of their&nbsp; dreams through creating projects and learning together as peers.&nbsp; He is a&nbsp; seeker and a perpetual incubator of projects, including: the Open&nbsp; Masters Program, Citizen Circles, Emergent Workshops, the Living&nbsp; Transcript, the School of Social Innovation...<br><br><br></body>
