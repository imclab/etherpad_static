<body><strong><u># Break it down and put it back together- making your first challenge!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Description:<br>By now you should have a clear idea of the setup for your challenge, what your learners will be doing and making during your challenge (and why), in order for them to demonstrate that they know the skills you want to teach them. It is time to break everything down to smaller steps and put it back together, to make your first challenge!&nbsp;<br><br>Gear: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;</a>, paper, post-its and markers.<br><br>Time: 2 hours<br><br><strong><u>## Task 1 - Break it down to smaller steps</u></strong><br><em>Create a trajectory of smaller steps that a peer needs to take in order to achieve your challenge&#x27;s final goal.</em><br><br>Scaffolding can help your learners overcome difficulties that might keep them from moving forward. To complete this task you will have to create a trajectory of smaller steps that a peer needs to take in order to achieve your challenge&#x27;s final goal. You can imagine this like a map; what &#8220;places&#8221;do you want your learners to go first, second and so on in order to reach their final &quot;destination&quot;? Design your trajectory to include &#8220;tasks&#8221; that are always doable but increasingly challenging. Each &quot;task&quot; should have a specific outcome and directly connect to the next &quot;task&quot;.&nbsp;<br><br>You can use post-its and markers or even a real map to create your trajectory. Share your work with the other peers in the discussion wall and leave feedback on their posts.<br><br>&nbsp;(I will add example)<br><br><strong><u>## Task 2: Make it &quot;peer to peer&quot;&nbsp;</u></strong><br><em>Come up with ways to encourage the peers who will be taking your challenge to teach and give feedback to each other</em><br><br>Challenges are designed to provide opportunities for peers to work together and assess each others work. In this task you will come up with ways to encourage the peers who will be taking your challenge to teach and give feedback to each other. For example, are there certain tasks from your trajectory that could work better when they are collaborative? How could you encourage discussion in your challenge? Make a list of ideas for your challenge and share it with the other peers in the discussion wall.<br><br><strong><u>## Task 3: Put it back together!</u></strong><br><em>Make a draft of your first challenge to share with the rest of your peers</em><br><br>To complete this task you will put all the pieces back together and make a draft of your first challenge to share with the rest of your peers. An important part of making a challenge here at p2pu.org is<em> playtesting</em> it, in order to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t before you go live.&nbsp;<br><br>But before we reach the <em>playtesting</em> stage, let&#x27;s get start making your challenge draft. You can use a free collaborative text editor tool such as pad.p2pu.org to make your draft challenge. If you want to see an example of an existing challenge draft you can check out this one [link]<br><br>Your draft should include the following sections:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Tip: The title should ask your peers to solve a problem<br><br><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Tip: Use the pitch you created in challenge 2 to explain to your peers what they will be doing during the challenge and what the final goal is. Keep this short and sweet.<br><br><strong>Time:</strong><br>Tip: We recommend that you fill this in after a few people have playtested your challenge and given you an idea of how long it took them to complete it.<br><br><strong>Tasks:</strong><br>Tip: Use the trajectory you made to write up individual tasks that will help your peers reach the challenge goals. Make sure to keep them short and similar in length, use examples and opportunities for peers to work together as part of the task.<br><br>Once you are done with your draft share it with your peers in the discussion wall and leave feedback on their posts.<br><br><strong><u>## Task 4 - Playtest &amp; give feedback to your peers</u></strong><br><em>Find out what works and what doesn&#x27;t in your peers&#x27; challenges</em><br><br>Next you will playtest at least one of your peers&#x27; challenge. Try to finish the challenge and answer (some of) the following questions.&nbsp;<br><br>Was the challenge fun? What in specific was fun to do?<br>What are the skills you think this challenge aims to teach the learner? How important are they to pursuing the challenge?<br>What other activities, games, websites do you know that teach something similar?<br>Is this challenge worth playing again? Would it lead to diffrerent outcomes?<br>How clear and simple were the titles and descriptions?<br>How hard was this challenge to accomplish?<br>Any other adjustments you would make?<br><br><strong><u>## Task 5 - it&#x27;s Iteration Round!</u></strong><br><em>Apply the suggestions you got from playtesting to your challenge</em><br><br>If you have collected some feedback and you feel that your draft could benefit from a revision then go ahead and post a new iteration of your masterpiece on the discussion wall.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><u>## Task 6 - Post your challenge, you are live!</u></strong><br><em>Post your first challenge at p2pu.org and share with your peers</em><br><br>The moment you were waiting for is here, go to p2pu.org&#x2F;contribute, create a study group, and start crafting your first challenge! If you get stuck, we are here to help; watch this screen-cast we made here at p2pu.org of how to use the interface to post your first challenge.<br><br>================<br>Community Feedback<br>================<br>Need to add examples<br><br>overall breakdown that worked;<br><br>1.goals<br>2.skills<br>3.methods<br>4.pitch<br>5.activity roadmap<br>6.tasks<br><br>Awesome challenge Chloe &#8211; looks great. Wondering if we should use some images to explain certain ideas in the Challenge 101s. For example, Task 1 with an image of the cookie idea from challenge 1 broken into tasks (written on postits or whatever). Some people might need a visual to help understand what we actually want them to do. Just a thought.<br>+1 Agreed absolutely necessary !<br><br></body>
