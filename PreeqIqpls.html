<body>idea&nbsp;<br><br>The idea that a new generation of students is entering the education system<br>has excited recent attention among educators and education commentators.<br>Termed &#8216;digital natives&#8217; or the &#8216;Net generation&#8217;, these young people are said to<br>have been immersed in technology all their lives, imbuing them with sophisticated<br>technical skills and learning preferences for which traditional education<br>is unprepared. Grand claims are being made about the nature of this generational<br>change and about the urgent necessity for educational reform in<br>response. A sense of impending crisis pervades this debate. However, the actual<br>situation is far from clear. In this paper, the authors draw on the fields of<br>education and sociology to analyse the digital natives debate. The paper presents<br>and questions the main claims made about digital natives and analyses<br>the nature of the debate itself. We argue that rather than being empirically and<br>theoretically informed, the debate can be likened to an academic form of a<br>&#8216;moral panic&#8217;. We propose that a more measured and disinterested approach<br>is now required to investigate &#8216;digital natives&#8217; and their implications for<br>education.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></body>
