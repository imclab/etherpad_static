We have not built out tools for social<br>organizing or communication beyond the&nbsp; standard text wiki page. Since<br>that is P2PU&#x27;s expertise, I think we are naturally complementary.<br><br>A couple models come to mind for P2PU language courses that use<br>Wikiotics as the lesson mechanism.<br><br>&nbsp;1) One (or few) teacher(s), many students<br>This is similar to a traditional language class except that meetings<br>happen online, if they happen at all. One or more teachers would put<br>together a progression of lessons in Wikiotics and be available as a<br>guide to students as they move through the material, building new<br>material or pointing individual students to additional lessons as they<br>run into difficulty.<br><br>In addition to the lessons, student assignments could take the form of<br>one-on-one practice with other class members over IM&#x2F;skype&#x2F;etc,<br>attending local language meetups, and&#x2F;or building customized versions of<br>the original lessons just as teachers often have students build their<br>own flash cards to aid in remembering the material.&nbsp; In that last case,<br>by uploading their own audio for a lesson, students build a way for the<br>P2PU teacher(s) to evaluate their pronunciation asynchronously.<br><br>2) No teachers, many peers<br>Instead of a traditional class structure, you have a P2PU &quot;class&quot;<br>composed of two groups of peers, each of whom is interested in knowing<br>the other group&#x27;s native language. In this model, students self-direct<br>their studies, relying on the their peers as a source of explanations<br>and new study materials.<br><br>Questions, like how the counting form changes when talking about<br>few&#x2F;many items, are answered in the form of a Wikiotics lesson so that<br>the group will gradually build a collection of material through the<br>interactions of individual members. Similarly, peers within the same<br>group can help each other by trying to learn lessons that explain<br>concepts they have just mastered. Members of the other group can verify<br>the accuracy of the lesson, and perhaps provide native audio or<br>localized pictures where appropriate, or correct any inaccuracies.<br><br>I think either of those would be exciting projects we can do right now<br>with the existing infrastructure on the site. Since both class<br>structures would end up producing materials that could be built from or<br>directly reused by future classes, once we get a class or two going, it<br>should become that much easier for future classes to start up<br>organically on P2PU.<br><br>I would be happy to offer some support on the Wikiotics end with some<br>screencast HowTOs, general question answering, and whatever feature<br>requests we can get developed.<br><br>--Some site links from wikiotics.org--<br><br>Demo picture choice lesson: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Introduction">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Introduction</a><br>Sample text-only multiple choice lesson:<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;WANY&#x5f;6&#x5f;grammar">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;WANY_6_grammar</a><br>Series of lessons built for public library conversation classes:<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;WANY">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikiotics.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;WANY</a><br><br>We also have a local MeetUp starting here in NY later this month.
